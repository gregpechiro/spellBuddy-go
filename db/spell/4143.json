Light undergrowth becomes heavy undergrowth in hill terrain, and slopes seem steeper than their elevation would indicate. It takes 2 squares of movement to move uphill on a gradual slope, and 4 squares to move uphill on a steep slope.

Creatures who fail Climb checks or make loud  noises have a 10% chance of starting an avalanche (\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eDMG\u003c/span\u003e 90). Altitude effects are one category worse: areas lower than 5,000 feet are treated as the 5,000- to 15,000-foot category, and anything above 5,000 feet is treated as being above 15,000 feet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlain:\u003c/strong\u003e Only natural grasslands change as a result of shadow landscape, but they become wide-open spaces with stands of thick bushes where thunderstorms and tornados are frequent.

When rolling random weather (\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eDMG\u003c/span\u003e 94), roll twice and take the higher result. In plains terrain, roll three times and take the highest result.

When you cast shadow landscape, you can designate one creature per four caster levels as a designated traveler. Creatures so designated don\u0026#39;t suffer the terrain-specific effects of the spell, but they\u0026#39;re still subject to the bad weather.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can also designate one or more animals, plants, or magical beasts native to the spell\u0026#39;s area as shadow guardians of the landscape. You can designate 1 HD of creature per caster level, split up however you like. For example, a 20th-level druid could designate two treants (7 HD each) and a dire wolf (6 HD) as shadow guardians. As long as the designated guardians remain within the spell\u0026#39;s area, they have a friendly attitude toward you and the travelers you have designated, and they also gain the following special qualities: resistance to cold 10, darkvision out to 60 feet, damage reduction 5/magic, evasion, and lowlight vision. If the creature already has one or more of these special qualities, use the better value.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":true,"Duration":"24 hours/level (D)","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":false,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Shadow Landscape","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":184,"Public":false,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"Reflex partial; see text","School":"Illusion","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)","SpellResistance":"Yes","Subschool":"Shadow","Target":"","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"VisualDisplay":false,"XPComponent":false}}
