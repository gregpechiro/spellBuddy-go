or smashing down nearly everything in its path.\u003cbr /\u003eThe effect lasts for 1 round, although the water created by the spell does not disappear after 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground within the area cannot move or attack.\u003cbr /\u003eA spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) to successfully cast a spell.\u003cbr /\u003eThe force of the water and debris deals those caught in the area 1d6 points of nonlethal damage plus another 1d6 points per five caster levels (maximum 4d6).\u003cbr /\u003eAny creature or object that is not soundly secured is pushed violently to the outer edge of the area.\u003cbr /\u003eIf this forces the creature or object into a solid surface, it takes 8d6 points of damage.\u003cbr /\u003eA creature holding onto a sturdy object can make a DC 20 Strength check to avoid being moved.\u003cbr /\u003eA creature not already holding onto such an object can make a DC 20 Reflex save or Swim check to grab one.\u003cbr /\u003eA creature of Huge size or larger can make a DC 30 Strength check to dig in its feet and simply withstand the oncoming wave.\u003cbr /\u003eA creature that fails any of these checks falls prone in addition to being swept away.\u003cbr /\u003eThe specific effect and aftereffects of a flashflood spell on the environment depend on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.\u003cbr /\u003eWhen the spell is completed, a total volume of 100,000 cubic feet of water (400 5-foot squares, in a 120-ft. cone, 10 feet deep) is left behind.\u003cbr /\u003eThis water behaves like ordinary water\u0026#8212;draining away and leaving puddles in most cases, or perhaps forming a shallow lake or pond.\u003cbr /\u003eUnless the caster has taken care to create the flashflood in a cleared area, however, the water left behind is full of debris, dirt, and perhaps a few corpses.\u003cbr /\u003eSuch water is unfit to drink.\u003cbr /\u003eCave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The sudden surge of water knocks down support beams, but otherwise has no real effect, aside from filling the tunnel with water to a depth of 10 feet.\u003cbr /\u003eIf the area is insufficient to support 100,000 cubic feet of water, the water level rises above 10 feet until the entire volume is filled, or it spills outward from the confines of the original 400 squares.\u003cbr /\u003eWhat happens is based on the layout of the area.\u003cbr /\u003eIn the case of level terrain, the water simply drains away over the course of a minute or so, leaving pools in depressions from which it cannot drain.\u003cbr /\u003eWhen the ground in a tunnel is not level, the water might flood sections of the tunnel.\u003cbr /\u003eIn such cases, determine whether the flooded area is sufficient to contain the entire volume of water created\u0026#8212;\u003cbr /\u003eand, if not, how deeply the water floods the next level up.\u003cbr /\u003eAny creatures caught in water over their heads might drown.\u003cbr /\u003eFor example, Miyish casts flashflood in the dungeon of a ruined castle.\u003cbr /\u003eThe dungeon\u0026#39;s total volume is only 40,000 cubic feet (160 squares, with a 10-foot ceiling).\u003cbr /\u003eThe remaining 60,000 cubic feet of water has to go somewhere, so it rushes up and out the entrance to the dungeon.\u003cbr /\u003eSince the terrain above the dungeon is another level of the castle, and is basically watertight, the water collects up here.\u003cbr /\u003eThe total volume of this level is 80,000 cubic feet (320 squares, with a 10-foot ceiling), leaving 20,000 cubic feet of air.\u003cbr /\u003eSince the water has nowhere to go but up, and it has gone as high as it can, the water on this level is 7-1/2 feet deep (60,000 cubic feet divided by 8,000\u0026#8212;the square footage of 320 5-foot squares).\u003cbr /\u003eIf Miyish can\u0026#39;t swim or breathe water, he has made a grave tactical error by casting flashflood in an area too small to contain it.\u003cbr /\u003eCliffs: Casting flashflood at the base of a cliff has no effect on the cliff.\u003cbr /\u003eCasting flashflood from the top of a cliff can force creatures and objects over the edge, so that they take falling damage.\u003cbr /\u003eOpen Ground: Creatures on open ground are safest from the worst effects of flashflood.\u003cbr /\u003eThey might be knocked prone by the force of the water, or even swept 120 feet (24 squares) away, but they are not in any particular danger of drowning or being crushed.\u003cbr /\u003eStructure(s): Any structure standing on open ground takes 60 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden building, but not a structure built of stone, masonry, or reinforced masonry.\u003cbr /\u003eHardness reduces this damage, but it isn\u0026#39;t halved as damage dealt to objects normally is.\u003cbr /\u003eAny creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half).\u003cbr /\u003eThe debris is swept away by the flashflood.\u003cbr /\u003eRiver, Lake, or Marsh: The river, lake, or marsh overflows its banks, though with rivers the effect is transitory.\u003cbr /\u003eIn the case of lakes and marshes, determine how much the body of water overflows, given the 100,000 cubic feet of water added to it.\u003cbr /\u003eOnly calculate this amount if the total surface area of the lake or marsh is less than 40,000 square feet\u0026#8212;and even then, it\u0026#39;s only academic unless it is important to determine whether something on the shore gets wet.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Water","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":true,"Duration":"1
