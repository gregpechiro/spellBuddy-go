This new form is boneless and fluid, enabling the subject to pass through holes or narrow openings as small as 2 inches in diameter. While amorphous, the subject is immune to poison, polymorphing, and stunning, it cannot be flanked,  and it is not subject to critical hits. It gains a swim speed (if it does not have one already) equal to its land speed.
