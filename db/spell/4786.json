This magically seals the target and attaches a mystical alarm to this location.

The bearer of the key may freely pass the \u003cem\u003earcane seal\u003c/em\u003e without affecting it. Otherwise, a door or object secured with this spell can be opened only by breaking in or with a successful \u003cem\u003edispel magic\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eknock\u003c/em\u003e spell.
