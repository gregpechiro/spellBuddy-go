Any teleportation spell or effect (including all spells with the teleportation descriptor) can be anticipated, making the spell\u0026#39;s recipient instantly aware of the exact location where the teleporting creature will arrive (subject to the restrictions below), the creature\u0026#39;s size, and how many other creatures (and their sizes) are arriving with the teleporting creature. The spell also delays the arrival of the teleporting creature by 1 round (so that it arrives on its initiative count immediately before its next turn), generally giving the recipient of the spell and anyone else made aware of the information 1 round to act or ready actions. The teleporting creature does not perceive this delay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince a teleporting creature doesn\u0026#39;t necessarily arrive at the precise location it intends, the spell also functions against a creature that arrives in range even though its intended destination was elsewhere. For a creature that intends to teleport into range but inadvertently arrives outside the spell\u0026#39;s area, the spell gives the recipient awareness that a creature has attempted to teleport into range and delays the creature as normal, but doesn\u0026#39;t give any awareness as to the actual location of its imminent arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe spell has no effect on creatures attempting to teleport away from the spell\u0026#39;s area, although if their destination is within the area, the spell will affect their reentry as normal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFocus:\u003c/strong\u003e A tiny hourglass of platinum and crystal costing at least 500 gp, which must be carried or worn by the spell\u0026#39;s recipient while the spell is in effect.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"24 hours","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":false,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Anticipate Teleportation","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":13,"Public":false,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"None","School":"Abjuration","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"One willing creature touched","SpellResistance":"No","Subschool":"","Target":"","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"VisualDisplay":false,"XPComponent":false}}
