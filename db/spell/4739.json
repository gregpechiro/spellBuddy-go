The spell must be cast so that it rests on a solid surface. Once cast, the wall is immobile. The sand is sufficiently thick to block ranged attacks, providing normal cover appropriate for its size, but creatures can attempt to force their way through it. Moving through a wall of sand is difficult, requiring a full-round action and a Strength check. A creature moves 5 feet through a wall of sand for every 5 points by which its Strength check result exceeds 10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreatures within a wall of sand are considered blinded and deafened, and they are unable to speak or breathe. Thus, they might begin to suffocate (\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eDMG\u003c/span\u003e 304) if they remain within the wall too long.
