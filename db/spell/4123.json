The stone is 1 inch thick, has hardness 8, and requires 15 points of damage to break through. Decreasing its size does not change the thickness of the walls; the coffin is always just large enough to hold the subject. This coffin is sealed upon formation and completely impervious to air and gas. A creature trapped within a  sarcophagus of stone has 1 hour worth of air, and after that time must hold its breath or begin to suffocate (\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eDMG\u003c/span\u003e 304). A creature that has no need to breathe (such as a construct, elemental, or undead) needs not fear suffocation, but it remains trapped within the sarcophagus until it breaks free or is freed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA creature within the coffin can attack the stone with a natural weapon or light melee weapon.
