The spell deals 5 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points). At the same time, you gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt, up to a maximum equal to the current hit points of the target. For example, a 13th-level cleric would normally deal 65 points of damage to an undead creature. However, if that creature had only 48 hit points remaining, the caster would gain only 48 hit points (even as the target was destroyed). These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. A successful Will save halves the damage dealt and the hit points gained.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis spell is often cast on willing undead to aid their living masters.
