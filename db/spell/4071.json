Your body shakes uncontrollably, as if eagerly anticipating the power behind those spells.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis spell functions like \u003ca href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dispel-magic--2315/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003edispel magic\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (PH 223), except that your caster level for your dispel check is a maximum of +20 instead of +10, and (as with greater dispel magic) you have a chance to dispel any effect that remove curse can remove, even if dispel magic can\u0026#39;t dispel that effect. When casting a targeted dispel or counterspell, you can choose to reave each spell you successfully dispel, stealing its power and effect for yourself. When making a targeted dispel, make a Spellcraft check (DC 25 + spell level) to identify the target spell or each ongoing spell currently in effect on the target creature or object. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach spell you dispel with a targeted dispel can be reaved if you so desire, and the spell\u0026#39;s effects are redirected to you, continuing as if cast on you by the original caster with no interruption to or extension of duration. Once you reave the spell, you identify it if you haven\u0026#39;t done so already (see below). If the subject was the caster and the spell is dismissible, you can dismiss it as if you had cast it yourself. Likewise, if the subject was the caster and the spell requires concentration, you must concentrate to maintain the spell\u0026#39;s effect as if you had cast it yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can still attempt to reave a spell you didn\u0026#39;t identify with your Spellcraft check, but doing so can be risky if you don\u0026#39;t know the specifics of the spell\u0026#39;s effect. For example, if you fail to identity an ongoing spell effect on an enemy character and choose to reave anyway, you might find yourself under the influence of the dominate person effect that character was suffering from. Any spell resistance you might have has no effect against harmful spells you might inadvertently reave, but you get the same chance to save against those spell effects as the original target.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you choose to reave a spell you have successfully counterspelled with reaving dispel, you seize control of the spell after the enemy caster completes it, and you can redirect the spell to whatever targets or area you wish (including the original caster, if appropriate). Again, you must make a Spellcraft check (DC 25 + spell level) to identify the spell you intend to reave, but you are free to choose to redirect a spell whose effect, range, and area you don\u0026#39;t know. If the redirected spell\u0026#39;s correct casting conditions aren\u0026#39;t met (because you guess at an improper target or range, for example), the spell fails.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eReaving dispel can be used to cast an area dispel with the increased maximum caster level, but any magical effects so dispelled cannot be reaved.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"Instantaneous","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Reaving Dispel","Page":169,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"See text","School":"Abjuration","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","SpellResistance":"No","Subschool":"","Target":"One spellcaster, creature, or object; or 20-ft.-radius burst","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"XPComponent":false}}
