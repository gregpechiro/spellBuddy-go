On a successful attack, the aura pulses angrily as it tears apart the negative energy sustaining the creature, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) and dazing it for 1 round. A successful Will save halves the damage and negates the daze effect. Since the spell utilizes positive energy to deal damage, incorporeal creatures do not benefit from the normal miss chance for incorporeality.
