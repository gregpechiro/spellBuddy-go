You can strike an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d6 +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack with a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis spell does not function underwater.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Fire","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"1 min./level (D)","Effect":"Flame in your palm","MaterialComponent":false,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Produce Flame","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":265,"Public":false,"Rulebook":"Player's Handbook v.3.5","SavingThrow":"None","School":"Evocation","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"0 ft.","SpellResistance":"Yes","Subschool":"","Target":"","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"VisualDisplay":false,"XPComponent":false}}
