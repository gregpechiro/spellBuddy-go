Each must attempt a Will saving throw every round they are within range, at the beginning of their turn. Failure means that the highest-level spell prepared by the spellcaster (or highest-level spell slot, if the character casts spells spontaneously) is lost for the day. The symbol remains active for 10 minutes per level or until it has erased fifty levels of spells. The symbol attacks creatures with spell-like abilities as if they had spells, consuming a daily use of the highest-level ability the creature possesses, or suppressing an ability usable at will for 1 round.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"See text","Effect":"One symbol","MaterialComponent":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Symbol of Spell Loss","Page":218,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"Will negates","School":"Abjuration","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"0 ft.; see text","SpellResistance":"No","Subschool":"","Target":"","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"XPComponent":false}}
