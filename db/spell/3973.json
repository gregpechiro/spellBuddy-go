The subject gestures as if making a melee attack, but the result of the attack affects a target within range. This spell does not actually grant reach, and so does not help provide a flanking bonus or allow the subject to make attacks of opportunity at any range greater than normal. The subject uses its normal melee attack bonuses and deals damage normally if it hits, though the target of the attacks can benefit from cover or concealment.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Blood Wind","Page":33,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"Will negates (harmless)","School":"Evocation","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","SpellResistance":"Yes (harmless)","Subschool":"","Target":"A single creature with Intelligence 4 or higher","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"XPComponent":false}}
