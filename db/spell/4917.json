The power grants a +4 enhancement bonus to the ability score you choose, adding the usual benefits provided by a high ability\r\nbonus. Because you are emulating the idealized form of the animal, you also take on minor aspects of the animal you choose (for instance, if you gain a +4 bonus to\r\nStrength, you may appear more bearlike; if gaining a +4 bonus to Dexterity, you may appear more catlike, and so on). If you choose to manifest powers, you do not gain\r\nthe benefit of an increased ability score long enough to gain any bonus power points for a high ability score, but save DCs of your powers increase for the duration of this\r\npower.\r\nAugment: For every 5 additional power points you spend, this power grants a +4 enhancement bonus to another ability.","Descriptors":"t","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"t","Effect":"t","MaterialComponent":false,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"t","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":0,"Public":true,"Rulebook":"t","SavingThrow":"t","School":"t","SomaticComponent":false,"SpellRange":"t","SpellResistance":"t","Subschool":"t","Target":"t","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":1,"VerbalComponent":false,"VisualDisplay":false,"XPComponent":false}}
