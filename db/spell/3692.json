If you hit, you deal normal melee damage plus an extra 15d6 points of damage, and a shadow spreads out from your enemy?s heart, freezing the blood in his veins. Roll a d20 and refer to the information below to determine toward which point of his body the freezing shadow spreads. This effect functions even if your opponent is not humanoid; once you have struck your foe?s heart, the shadow produces the same effects even in a creature with a different anatomy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResult of 1?7\u003c/strong\u003e: Spreads out to legs.
