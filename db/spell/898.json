this result is opposed by observers\u0026#39; Spot checks as normal.\u003cbr /\u003eAnyone touching the fetch finds it rubbery and soft, and in so doing immediately realizes its magical nature.\u003cbr /\u003eThe fetch\u0026#39;s body includes useless versions of all the equipment you possess: A weapon wielded by the fetch is too flimsy to deal damage, and tools it carries are fragile and imprecise.\u003cbr /\u003eItems created with a fetch are part of its form and dissipate if separated from it.\u003cbr /\u003eAt your order, the fetch can retrieve things for you, open unstuck doors, hold chairs, and the like, as well as perform menial tasks such as cleaning and mending.\u003cbr /\u003eThe fetch can\u0026#39;t perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a skill that can\u0026#39;t be used untrained.\u003cbr /\u003eIt can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity tirelessly if ordered to do so as long as you remain within the spell\u0026#39;s range.\u003cbr /\u003eYou can have the fetch imitate you, such as by sitting at a desk and pretending to write, lying in bed and breathing deeply, or skulking with a weapon drawn.\u003cbr /\u003eIt can even imitate tasks it can\u0026#39;t actually perform, though it automatically fails any attempt at such performance\u0026#8212;for instance, even though a fetch can pretend to decipher an ancient text, it can\u0026#39;t actually do it.\u003cbr /\u003eThe fetch weighs roughly the same as you do, so it can trigger any traps you would if you were to pass through the same space, setting off tripwires, pressure plates, some magical forms of detection, and similar devices.\u003cbr /\u003eIts land speed is normal for a creature of your kind (for example, 30 feet for a human or 20 feet for a halfling).\u003cbr /\u003eEven if you normally have other modes of movement available (such as a fly or swim speed), the fetch can\u0026#39;t use those.\u003cbr /\u003eThe fetch automatically fails any saving throw required of it.\u003cbr /\u003eIf you attempt to send it beyond the spell\u0026#39;s range (measured from your current position), it ceases to exist.\u003cbr /\u003eThe fetch has an effective Strength score of 6, so it can lift 60 pounds or drag 300 pounds.\u003cbr /\u003eIts Dexterity is 10, so it has an AC of 10 (plus size modifier).\u003cbr /\u003eIt gains no AC benefit from any equipment or effect on you when the spell is cast (such as armor you wear, since the armor created for it is part of its form), though it can then wear real armor or other items to increase its Armor Class.\u003cbr /\u003eIt has no Constitution score and 10 hit points; if reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\u003cbr /\u003eIt can\u0026#39;t be healed, nor can it benefit from temporary hit points.\u003cbr /\u003eThe fetch has no Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score.\u003cbr /\u003eYou can command it to make noise, but it can\u0026#39;t communicate in any way, nor can it understand instructions other than the simple orders you give it telepathically.\u003cbr /\u003eThe fetch cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll.\u003cbr /\u003eEven if armed, it doesn\u0026#39;t threaten an area around it and thus can\u0026#39;t flank an enemy, nor can it use the aid another action to improve your Armor Class or attack rolls.\u003cbr /\u003eThe fetch has the same alignment aura as you do.\u003cbr /\u003eDetect thoughts does not register its existence (since it has no Intelligence), but detect magic reveals it as a magical effect.\u003cbr /\u003eMaterial Component:One of your own hairs.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"10 minutes/level","Effect":"A duplicate of yourself","MaterialComponent":true,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Create Fetch","Page":0,"Rulebook":"Complete Scoundrel","SavingThrow":"None","School":"Conjuration","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","SpellResistance":"No","Subschool":"Creation","Target":"","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"XPComponent":false}}
