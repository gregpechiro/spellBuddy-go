If no large, natural source of water (a river, lake, or ocean) exists within the spell\u0026#39;s range, you can affect only one target. If such a source of water exists within the range of the spell, the spell creates a burst centered on a location you designate. In either case, the water deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to the target or to creatures within the burst.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, all affected creatures are subjected to a bull rush attack, forcing them to make opposed Strength checks against the wave of water. The water has a +5 bonus on the opposed Strength check, or a +10 bonus if the spell is cast near a source of water. You designate the direction the wave pushes when you cast the spell; creatures that lose the opposed Strength check are pushed back 5 feet, plus an additional 5 feet for every 5 points by which the wave beats their Strength checks, in the chosen direction. It is possible for a wave arising from a body of water to push characters into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe wave puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames if they are carried by the target or located within the area and they are Large or smaller.
