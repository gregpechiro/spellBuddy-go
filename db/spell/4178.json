Because these fires consume less of the physical fuel that sustain them, they burn for twice as long without losing any of their intensity, but their illumination radius is halved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, an affected fire is much harder to extinguish. It takes twice as long to put out a fire that is under the effect of this spell, and if a roll is required (such as the Reflex save required to extinguish flames if a creature is on fire), two successful rolls over 2 rounds are required to successfully put out the fire. If one such roll fails, the creature must begin trying to extinguish the flames again as if it had never succeeded on the first roll.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eMagical fire used against a target in this spell\u0026#39;s area, such as from a produce flame or fireball spell, does not burn as effectively, and fire damage from such sources is reduced by 1 point per die.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eSlow burn counters or dispels the effect of \u003ca href=\"/spells/spell-compendium--86/raging-flame--4055/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eraging flame\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (page 164).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eArcane Material Component: An oil-filled hourglass.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Fire","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":true,"Duration":"1 minute","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":true,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Slow Burn","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":192,"Public":false,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"None","School":"Transmutation","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","SpellResistance":"No","Subschool":"","Target":"","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"VisualDisplay":false,"XPComponent":false}}
