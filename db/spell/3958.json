After casting blade storm, you can take a full-round action to make one attack with each melee weapon you are currently wielding against every foe within reach. If you wield more than one weapon, or a double weapon, you can attack each foe once with each weapon or end, using the normal rules for two-weapon fighting (PH 160). So, a ranger wielding a longsword and a short sword could attack each opponent he can reach with both weapons. If you choose not to spend a full-round action in this fashion after casting the spell,  the spell has no effect.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"1 round","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Blade Storm","Page":30,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"no","School":"Transmutation","SomaticComponent":false,"SpellRange":"Personal","SpellResistance":"no","Subschool":"","Target":"You","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"XPComponent":false}}
