This attack deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. If the creature hit is standing on the ground, your attack also drops the target?s speed to 0 feet (for all movement capabilities) for 1 round. It can otherwise act normally. A successful Fortitude save (DC 12 + your Str modifier) by the creature struck negates the immobilization, but not the extra damage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis maneuver functions only against opponents standing on the ground.
