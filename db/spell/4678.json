Paper becomes harder to tear, glass becomes harder to break, wood becomes more resilient, and so on. For every two caster levels, add 1 point of hardness to the material targeted by the spell. This hardness increase improves only the material\u0026#39;s resistance to damage. Nothing else is modified by the improvement. For example, a longsword (treat steel as iron, base hardness 10) affected by a hardening spell cast by a 12th-level caster would have hardness 16 for the purpose of ignoring damage caused by someone making a sunder attack. The sword\u0026#39;s hit points, attack and damage modifiers, and other factors are not affected. A hardening spell does not in any way affect a substance\u0026#39;s resistance to other forms of transformation. Ice still melts, paper and wood still burn, rock still becomes transmutable to mud with the proper spell, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis spell affects up to 10 cubic feet of material per level of the caster.
