You can remove yourself from the sphere without ending the spell, but while you are outside the \u003cem\u003edragonmark demesne\u003c/em\u003e, you cannot use any of your dragonmark powers for as long as the sphere persists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe temperature inside the \u003cem\u003edragonmark demesne\u003c/em\u003e is a steady 70Â° F.
