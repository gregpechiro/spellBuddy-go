The creature effectively has  unbeatable spell resistance regarding the chosen spell. Lesser spell immunity can\u0026#39;t protect a creature from a spell to which spell resistance doesn\u0026#39;t apply. This spell works against other spells, spell-like effects, and innate spell-like abilities. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks. Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a school of spells or a group of spells with similar effects; thus, a creature given immunity to inflict light wounds is still susceptible to inflict moderate wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA creature can have only one lesser spell immunity or \u003ca href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/spell-immunity--2365/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003espell immunity\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (PH 282) in effect at a time.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"10 minutes/level","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":false,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Spell Immunity, Lesser","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":199,"Public":false,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"Will negates (harmless)","School":"Abjuration","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Touch","SpellResistance":"Yes (harmless)","Subschool":"","Target":"Creature touched","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"VisualDisplay":false,"XPComponent":false}}
