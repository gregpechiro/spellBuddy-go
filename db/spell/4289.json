As long as the creature isn\u0026#39;t carrying more than a light load, it can swim without making Swim checks. It also gains a +8 bonus on any Swim checks to perform special actions or avoid hazards, though it still takes the normal penalty for weight carried (\u0026#8212;1 per 5 pounds). The recipient can choose to take 10 on Swim checks, even if rushed or threatened, and can use the run action while swimming if it swims in a straight line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the creature is carrying more than a light load, it must make Swim checks to move (taking the normal penalty for weight carried), but all other benefits of the spell still apply.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaterial Component: A goldfish scale.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Water","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"10 minutes/level (D)","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":true,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Swim","Page":217,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"None","School":"Transmutation","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","SpellResistance":"Yes (harmless)","Subschool":"","Target":"One creature","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"XPComponent":false}}
