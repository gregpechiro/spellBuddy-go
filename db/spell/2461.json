is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home.\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026quot;Studied carefully\u0026quot; is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you\u0026#39;ve been there often, or you have used other means (such as scrying) to study the place for at least one hour.\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026quot;Seen casually\u0026quot; is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar.\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026quot;Viewed once\u0026quot; is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.\u003cbr /\u003e\u0026quot;False destination\u0026quot; is a place that does not truly exist, such as if you scryed on a enemy\u0026#39;s sanctum but instead viewed a false vision, or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you (for instance, a home that has burned to the ground).\u003cbr /\u003eWhen traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.\u003cbr /\u003eOn Target: You appear where you want to be.\u003cbr /\u003eOff Target: You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction.\u003cbr /\u003eDistance off target is 1d10\u0026#215;1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled.\u003cbr /\u003eFor example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be 15% off target.\u003cbr /\u003eThat\u0026#39;s 18 miles, in this case.\u003cbr /\u003eThe DM determines the direction off target randomly, such as by rolling 1d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, and so forth.\u003cbr /\u003eIf you were teleporting to a coastal city and would up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\u003cbr /\u003eSimilar Area: You wind up in an area that\u0026#39;s visually or thematically similar to the target area.\u003cbr /\u003eA wizard heading for her home laboratory might wind up in another wizard\u0026#39;s laboratory or in an alchemy supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as in her laboratory.\u003cbr /\u003eGenerally, you appear in the closest similar place within range.\u003cbr /\u003eIf the DM determines no such area exists within the spell\u0026#39;s range, the spell simply fails instead.\u003cbr /\u003eMishap: You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten \u0026quot;scrambled\u0026quot;.\u003cbr /\u003eYou each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up.\u003cbr /\u003eFor these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.\u003cbr /\u003eEach time \u0026quot;Mishap\u0026quot;
