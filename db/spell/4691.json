Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (although a 3rd-level or higher magical darkness effect functions normally), blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. In addition, if they fail a Fortitude save, affected creatures take 1d4 points of fire damage each round as their passions manifest as physically damaging fire. Creatures that make a successful Fortitude save take only half damage each round for the duration of the spell (minimum 1 point per round). Spellcasters affected by this spell who try to cast spells must make Concentration checks (DC 10 + half the continuous damage last dealt) each round as they take continuous damage from the spell. The fire created by this spell can be extinguished by normal means; doing so ends the outlining effect.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Fire, Light","DivineFocusComponent":true,"Duration":"1 round/level","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Heartfire","Page":112,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"Fortitude partial","School":"Evocation","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","SpellResistance":"Yes","Subschool":"","Target":"","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"XPComponent":false}}
