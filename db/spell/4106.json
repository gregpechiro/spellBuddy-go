You can revive a destroyed undead creature that has been inactive for up to one day per caster level. In addition, the subject\u0026#39;s animating spirit must be free and willing to return. If the subject\u0026#39;s animating spirit is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, subjects that want to revive receive no saving throw.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eRevive undead restores hit points to the subject up to a total of 1 hit point per Hit Die.

An undead that was destroyed with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being revived, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A spellcasting undead creature that doesn\u0026#39;t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaterial Component: A black pearl worth at least 5,000 gp.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Evil","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"Instantaneous","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":true,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Revive Undead","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":175,"Public":false,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"None","School":"Necromancy","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Touch","SpellResistance":"No","Subschool":"","Target":"Destroyed undead creature touched","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"VisualDisplay":false,"XPComponent":false}}
