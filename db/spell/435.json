Any teleportation spell or effect (including all spells with the teleportation descriptor) can be anticipated, making the spell\u0026#39;s recipient instantly aware of the exact location where the teleporting creature will arrive (subject to the restrictions below), the creature\u0026#39;s size, and how many other creatures (and their sizes) are arriving with the teleporting creature. The spell also delays the arrival of the teleporting creature by 1 round (so that it arrives on its initiative count immediately before its next turn), generally giving the recipient of the spell and anyone else made aware of the information 1 round to act or ready actions.
