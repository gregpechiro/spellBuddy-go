You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. You can make a single ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, or 2d6 points of damage against undead or evil outsiders, with a range of 30 feet. Spell resistance applies to this attack. This dims your silvery radiance to half (15-foot light, with dim light for an additional 15 feet). You can choose to fire one additional ray with the same characteristics either on the same round or on a subsequent round. Firing the second ray quenches your radiance and ends the spell.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Good, Light","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"10 minutes/level (D) or until discharged; see text","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":false,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Light of Lunia","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":132,"Public":false,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"None","School":"Evocation","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","SpellResistance":"Yes; see text","Subschool":"","Target":"You and up to two rays; see text","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"VisualDisplay":false,"XPComponent":false}}
