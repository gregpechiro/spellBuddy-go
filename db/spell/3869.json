Axiomatic water damages chaotic outsiders the way holy water damages undead and evil outsiders. A flask of axiomatic water can be thrown as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, the bearer must open the flask and pout the axiomatic water out onto the target. Thus, a character can douse an incorporeal creature with axiomatic water only if he is adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA direct hit by a flask of axiomatic water deals 2d4 points of damage to a chaotic outsider.
