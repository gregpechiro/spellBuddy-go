This spell imbues the caster with an ability to heal minor wounds that lasts throughout the day. When you cast this spell, you store healing energy within your own form that can then be used to heal a number of hit points equal to twice your caster level (maximum 10 hp). You may choose to divide this healing among multiple recipients, and you don\u0026#39;t have to use it all at once. Delivering healing with this spell requires a touch (a standard action) but does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe effects of multiple touch of Jorasco spells do not stack, meaning that you can only store healing energy from one such spell at a time.
