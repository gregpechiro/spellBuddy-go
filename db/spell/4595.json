A successful Reflex save halves the damage. Creatures who fail their saves are also buried (\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eDMG\u003c/span\u003e 90). All squares within 20 feet of the center point are covered in heavy snow (\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eDMG\u003c/span\u003e 94), which persists as long as ordinary snow would. A buried creature can free itself with a DC 20 Strength check as a full-round action, and can be dug free by others (a single creature working alone requires 1 minute to free a trapped creature). A trapped creature is unable to move, and cannot cast spells with somatic components, and any material components must be in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBetween 20 feet and 40 feet of the Center Point:\u003c/strong\u003e Creatures take half as much damage from the impact of the avalanche as the creatures nearer the center point took (Reflex negates). Creatures who fail their saves must also resist the force of the snow moving past them as if they were being bull rushed. The snow has a +13 attack bonus (+5 for effective Strength of 20 and +8 for effectively being Huge) on the bull rush check, and it pushes characters away from the center point of the spell. All squares in the 20-foot to 40-foot ring are covered in snow (\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eDMG\u003c/span\u003e 94), which persists as long as ordinary snow would.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTerrain and Structures:\u003c/strong\u003e The avalanche uproots small trees and other vegetation automatically, and it leaves a trail of light rubble (\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eDMG\u003c/span\u003e 91) even after the snow melts.
