The fires you enter and move between must be at least as big around as you are. Fire elementals and other fire creatures are not considered \u0026quot;fires\u0026quot; for the purpose of this spell, nor are sources of great heat, such as pools of lava.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce in a fire, you can instantly know the locations of all suitable fires within long range (400 ft. + 40 ft/level) and can transport yourself to one of them. Each transport counts as a full-round action. With each casting of the spell, you can transport yourself once per caster level. If a fire\u0026#39;s location doesn\u0026#39;t offer enough space for you (for example, a fire contained inside a furnace too small to hold you or a fire already occupied by a big cauldron), it is not a viable destination and you don\u0026#39;t sense its location. If a fire rests on a surface that can\u0026#39;t support you, it is still a viable destination and you suffer the appropriate consequences if you transport yourself to it. For example, if you transport yourself into a fire burning in a pit full of oil, you fall into the oil when you arrive there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFire stride\u003c/em\u003e provides no protection against fire, so it is advisable to obtain such protection before using the spell.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Teleportation","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"10 minutes/level or until expended; see text","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":false,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Fire Stride","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":93,"Public":false,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"","School":"Transmutation","SomaticComponent":false,"SpellRange":"Personal","SpellResistance":"","Subschool":"","Target":"You","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":false,"VisualDisplay":false,"XPComponent":false}}
