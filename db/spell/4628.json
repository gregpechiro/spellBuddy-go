If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control and any excess undead from previous castings of this spell or animate dead become uncontrolled. Any time you must release part of the undead that you control because of this spell or animate dead, you choose which undead are released until the total HD of undead you control is equal to four times your caster level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe bones and bodies required for this spell follow the same restrictions as animate dead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaterial Component: A black sapphire worth 100 gp or several black sapphires with a total value of 100 gp.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Evil","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"Instantaneous","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":true,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Plague of Undead","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":158,"Public":false,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"None","School":"Necromancy","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","SpellResistance":"No","Subschool":"","Target":"One or more corpses within range","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"VisualDisplay":false,"XPComponent":false}}
