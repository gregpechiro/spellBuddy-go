You can then make a trip attempt against your enemy. You gain a +4 bonus on the ability check.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you succeed in tripping your foe, you throw him up to 10 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. You select your enemy?s destination square. The target falls prone in that space and takes 4d6 points of damage. For every 5 points by which you win the opposed check, you gain an additional 5 feet of throw range. For example, if you win by 10, you can place your foe in any space within 20 feet of you. You can throw your opponent into a space occupied by a second foe. In this case, the opponent in the target square also takes 4d6 points of damage and is knocked prone. A Reflex save (DC 14 + your Str modifier) halves this damage and allows the second target to remain standing. The thrown creature then falls prone in a clear space of your choice adjacent to the second target.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Comet Throw","Page":71,"Rulebook":"Tome of Battle: The Book of Nine Swords","SavingThrow":"Reflex partial; see text","School":"Setting Sun","SomaticComponent":false,"SpellRange":"Touch","SpellResistance":"","Subschool":"Strike","Target":"Creature touched; see text","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":false,"XPComponent":false}}
