It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be banished. You can improve the spell\u0026#39;s chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target\u0026#39;s spell resistance (if any), the saving throw DC increases by 2. For example, if this spell were cast on a demon that hated light and was vulnerable to holy water and cold iron weapons, you might use iron, holy water, and a torch in the spell. The three items would give you a +3 bonus on your check to overcome the demon\u0026#39;s spell resistance and add 6 to the spell\u0026#39;s save DC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the DM\u0026#39;s option, certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a +2 bonus on the caster level check against spell resistance and increasing the save DC by 4).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eArcane Focus: Any item that is distasteful to the subject (optional, see above).\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"Instantaneous","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":false,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Banishment","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":203,"Public":false,"Rulebook":"Player's Handbook v.3.5","SavingThrow":"Will negates","School":"Abjuration","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","SpellResistance":"Yes","Subschool":"","Target":"One or more extraplanar creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"VisualDisplay":false,"XPComponent":false}}
