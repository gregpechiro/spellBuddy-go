worth of creatures, whichever comes first.\u003cbr /\u003eAny creature that enters the area while the symbol of death is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered.\u003cbr /\u003eA creature need save against the symbol only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the symbol is still active, it must save again.\u003cbr /\u003eUntil it is triggered, the symbol of death is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet).\u003cbr /\u003eTo be effective, a symbol of death must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location.\u003cbr /\u003eCovering or hiding the rune renders the symbol of death ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the symbol of death works normally.\u003cbr /\u003eAs a default, a symbol of death is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune.\u003cbr /\u003eRegardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can\u0026#39;t trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune).\u003cbr /\u003eOnce the spell is cast, a symbol of death\u0026#39;s triggering conditions cannot be changed.\u003cbr /\u003eIn this case, \u0026quot;reading\u0026quot; the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning.\u003cbr /\u003eThrowing a cover over a symbol of death to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch.\u003cbr /\u003eYou can\u0026#39;t use a symbol of death offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered symbol of death remains untriggered if an item bearing the symbol of death is used to touch a creature.\u003cbr /\u003eLikewise, a symbol of death cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.\u003cbr /\u003eYou can also set special triggering limitations of your own.\u003cbr /\u003eThese can be as simple or elaborate as you desire.\u003cbr /\u003eSpecial conditions for triggering a symbol of death can be based on a creature\u0026#39;s name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.\u003cbr /\u003eIntangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, and hit points don\u0026#39;t qualify.\u003cbr /\u003eFor example, a symbol of death can be set to activate when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.\u003cbr /\u003eWhen scribing a symbol of death, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the effect.\u003cbr /\u003eAnyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune\u0026#39;s effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune.\u003cbr /\u003eIf the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.\u003cbr /\u003eYou also can attune any number of creatures to the symbol of death, but doing this can extend the casting time.\u003cbr /\u003eAttuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as ten creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour.\u003cbr /\u003eAttuning a large group (as many as twenty-five creatures) takes 24 hours.\u003cbr /\u003eAttuning larger groups takes proportionately longer, as the DM sees fit.\u003cbr /\u003eAny creature attuned to a symbol of death cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when triggered.\u003cbr /\u003eYou are automatically considered attuned to your own symbols of death, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.\u003cbr /\u003eRead magic allows you to identify a symbol of death with a DC 19 Spellcraft check.\u003cbr /\u003eOf course, if the symbol of death is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.\u003cbr /\u003eA symbol of death can be removed by a successful dispel magic targeted solely on the rune.\u003cbr /\u003eAn erase spell has no effect on a symbol of death.\u003cbr /\u003eDestruction of the surface where a symbol of death is inscribed destroys the symbol but also triggers it.\u003cbr /\u003eSymbol of death can be made permanent with a permanency spell.\u003cbr /\u003eA permanent symbol of death that is disabled or that has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then can be triggered again as normal.\u003cbr /\u003eNote:Magic traps such as symbol of death are hard to detect and disable.\u003cbr /\u003eA rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of death and Disable Device to thwart it.\u003cbr /\u003eThe DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for symbol of death.\u003cbr /\u003eMaterial Component:Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp each.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Death","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"See text","Effect":"One symbol","MaterialComponent":true,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Symbol of Death","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":289,"Public":false,"Rulebook":"Player's Handbook v.3.5","SavingThrow":"Fortitude negates","School":"Necromancy","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"0 ft.;
