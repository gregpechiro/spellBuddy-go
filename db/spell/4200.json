This spectral weapon appears in your hand and behaves as a normal weapon of its type, with two exceptions. First, you resolve attacks with your spectral weapon as melee touch attacks instead of melee attacks. Second, any foe you hit is entitled to a Will save to recognize the  weapon\u0026#39;s shadowy, semi-insubstantial nature. If the save is successful, that opponent takes only half damage from the weapon on that attack and all subsequent attacks, and is only 50% likely to suffer any special effects of your attacks (such as a death attack delivered with the weapon).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can maintain only one spectral weapon at a time, and only you can wield it.
