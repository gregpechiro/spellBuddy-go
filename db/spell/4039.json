A creature that makes its initial Will save suffers no ill effects. A creature that fails its initial save can attempt a new saving throw each round until it succeeds or the spell expires. Failing the subsequent saving throws results in continued blindness. Success on a later save means the creature feels its vision beginning to clear, although its vision remains dim and hazy for the remainder of the spell. This results in a 20% miss chance for any attack the creature makes.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Mind-Affecting","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"1 round/level","Effect":"","MaterialComponent":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Cone of Dimness","Page":50,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"Will negates; see text","School":"Illusion","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"60 ft.","SpellResistance":"Yes","Subschool":"Phantasm","Target":"","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"XPComponent":false}}
