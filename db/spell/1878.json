failure indicates that it either does exactly the opposite or refuses to do anything at all for one day (DM\u0026#39;s option as to which).\u003cbr /\u003eA bogun cannot speak, but the process of creating one links it telepathically with its creator.\u003cbr /\u003eIt knows what its creator knows and can convey to him or her everything it sees and hears, up to a range of 500 yards.\u003cbr /\u003eA bogun never travels beyond this range willingly, though it can be removed forcibly.\u003cbr /\u003eIn that case, it does everything in its power to regain contact with its creator.\u003cbr /\u003eAn attack that destroys a bogun also deals its creator 2d10 points of damage.\u003cbr /\u003eIf the creator is slain, the bogun also dies, and its body collapses into a heap of rotting vegetation.\u003cbr /\u003eA bogun looks like a vaguely humanoid mound of compost.\u003cbr /\u003eThe creator determines its precise features, but the typical bogun stands about 18 inches tall and has a wingspan of about 2 feet.\u003cbr /\u003eIts skin is covered with nettles and branches.\u003cbr /\u003eCombat\u003cbr /\u003eA bogun attacks by brushing against opponents with harsh nettles that deliver an irritating poison.\u003cbr /\u003ePoison (Ex): Nettles, Fort save (DC 11); initial and secondary damage 1d6 temporary Dex.\u003cbr /\u003eThe creator of a bogun is immune to its poison.\u003cbr /\u003eConstruct Traits: Immune to mind-influencing effects, poison, disease, and similar effects.\u003cbr /\u003eNot subject to critical hits, subdual damage, ability damage, energy drain, or death from massive damage.\u003cbr /\u003eAlthough it is made of vegetable matter, a bogun is not a plant and is therefore is not subject to spells that affect only plants.\u003cbr /\u003eConstruction\u003cbr /\u003eUnlike a homunculus, a bogun is created from natural materials available in any forest.\u003cbr /\u003eThus, there is no gold piece cost for its creation.\u003cbr /\u003eAll materials used become permanent parts of the bogun.\u003cbr /\u003eThe creator must be at least 7th level and possess the Craft Wondrous Item feat to make a bogun.\u003cbr /\u003eBefore casting any spells, a physical form must be woven out of living (or once-living) vegetable matter to hold the magical energy.\u003cbr /\u003eA bit of the creator\u0026#39;s own body, such as a few strands of hair or a drop of blood, must also be incorporated into this crude mannequin.\u003cbr /\u003eThe creator may assemble the body personally or hire someone else to do it.\u003cbr /\u003eCreating the mannequin requires a Craft (basketweaving or weaving) check (DC 12).\u003cbr /\u003eOnce the body is finished, the creator must animate it through an extended magical ritual that requires a week to complete.\u003cbr /\u003eThe creator must labor for at least 8 hours each day in complete solitude in a forest grove; any interruption from another sentient creature undoes the magic.\u003cbr /\u003eIf the creator is personally weaving the creature\u0026#39;s body, that process and the ritual can be performed together.\u003cbr /\u003eWhen not actively working on the ritual, the creator must rest and can perform no other activities except eating, sleeping, or talking.\u003cbr /\u003eMissing even one day causes the process to fail.\u003cbr /\u003eAt that point, the ritual must be started anew, though the previously crafted body and the grove can be reused.\u003cbr /\u003eOn the final day of the ritual, the creator must personally cast control plants, wood shape, and beget bogun.\u003cbr /\u003eThese spells can come from outside sources, such as scrolls, rather than being prepared, if the creator prefers.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"Instantaneous","Effect":"Tiny construct","MaterialComponent":true,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Beget Bogun","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":0,"Public":false,"Rulebook":"Masters of the Wild: A Guidebook to Barbarians, Druids, and Rangers","SavingThrow":"None","School":"Conjuration","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Touch","SpellResistance":"No","Subschool":"Creation","Target":"","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"VisualDisplay":false,"XPComponent":true}}
