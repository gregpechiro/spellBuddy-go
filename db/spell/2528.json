if its Hit Dice equal at least one-half your caster level.\u003cbr /\u003eYou may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell.\u003cbr /\u003eFor each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1.\u003cbr /\u003eFor each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant\u0026#39;s level, provided that the spell\u0026#39;s target is appropriate for a binding spell.\u003cbr /\u003eSince the assistants\u0026#39; spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants\u0026#39; spells are irrelevant.\u003cbr /\u003eYour caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts.\u003cbr /\u003eAll binding spells are dismissible.\u003cbr /\u003eRegardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur.\u003cbr /\u003eThese triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass.\u003cbr /\u003eThe conditions can be based on a creature\u0026#39;s name, identity, or alignment but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities.\u003cbr /\u003eIntangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don\u0026#39;t qualify.\u003cbr /\u003eFor example, a bound creature can be released when a lawful good creature approaches, but not when a paladin approaches.\u003cbr /\u003eOnce the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed.\u003cbr /\u003eSetting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.\u003cbr /\u003eIf you are casting any of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, since the durations overlap.\u003cbr /\u003eIf you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell\u0026#39;s duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw.\u003cbr /\u003eIf the creature succeeds on this save, all the binding spells it has received are broken.\u003cbr /\u003eThe binding spell has six versions.\u003cbr /\u003eChoose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.\u003cbr /\u003eChaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you.\u003cbr /\u003eThe duration is one year per caster level.\u003cbr /\u003eThe subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell.\u003cbr /\u003eSlumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as one year per caster level.\u003cbr /\u003eThe subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age.\u003cbr /\u003eThis form of binding is more difficult to cast than chaining, making it slightly easier to resist.\u003cbr /\u003eReduce the spell\u0026#39;s save DC by 1.\u003cbr /\u003eBound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as one month per caster level.\u003cbr /\u003eReduce the save DC by 2.\u003cbr /\u003eHedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area (such as a labyrinth) from which it cannot wander by any means.\u003cbr /\u003eThe effect is permanent.\u003cbr /\u003eReduce the save DC by 3.\u003cbr /\u003eMetamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face.\u003cbr /\u003eIt is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose.\u003cbr /\u003eThe creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities.\u003cbr /\u003eThe binding is permanent.\u003cbr /\u003eThe subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age.\u003cbr /\u003eReduce the save DC by 4.\u003cbr /\u003eMinimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or even less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object.\u003cbr /\u003eThe binding is permanent.\u003cbr /\u003eThe subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age.\u003cbr /\u003eReduce the save DC by 4.\u003cbr /\u003eYou can\u0026#39;t dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or Mordenkainen\u0026#39;s disjunction affects it normally.\u003cbr /\u003eA bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane due to dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect.\u003cbr /\u003eComponents: The components for a binding spell vary according to the version of the spell, but they always include a continuous chanting utterance read from the scroll or spellbook page containing the spell, somatic gestures, and materials appropriate to the form of binding used.\u003cbr /\u003eThese components can include such items as miniature chains of special metals (silver for lycanthropes, cold iron for demons, and so forth), soporific herbs of the rarest sort (for slumber bindings), a bell jar of the finest crystal, and the like.\u003cbr /\u003eIn addition to the specially made props suited to the specific type of binding (cost 500 gp), the spell requires opals worth at least 500 gp for each HD of the target and a vellum depiction or carved statuette of the subject to be captured.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Mind-Affecting","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"See text
