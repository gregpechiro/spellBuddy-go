You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. It can effectively destroy any nonmagical iron or iron alloy object. Such objects struck by a rust ray take 2d6 points of damage +1 per two caster levels (maximum +10), ignoring hardness. You can also target a weapon being wielded or metal armor being worn. Metal armor affected by this ray takes normal damage from the spell and loses 1d4 points of Armor Class through corrosion. If an item is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
