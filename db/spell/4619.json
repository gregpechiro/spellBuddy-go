The blade flies at a speed of 40 feet (perfect) and attacks any target within its range, as you desire, starting in the round when you cast the spell. The blade attacks on your turn once each round, striking with an attack bonus equal to your base attack bonus + 1/2 your Cha modifier or Int modifier (for sorcerers and wizards, respectively) and deals 1d4 points of damage, with a critical threat range of 19-20. If an ally also attacks the creature, the blade moves on your turn to flank the target. As a force effect, it can strike ethereal and incorporeal creatures. The blade cannot be attacked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the blade to a new target; otherwise, it continues to attack the same target. If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time the persistent blade strikes. If the blade is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the blade has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eFocus: A silvered dagger.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Force","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"1 round/level","Effect":"One dagger made of force","MaterialComponent":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Persistent Blade","Page":154,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"None","School":"Evocation","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","SpellResistance":"Yes","Subschool":"","Target":"","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"XPComponent":false}}
