Simply cracking a sonic whip as a free action keeps normal animals (but not dire animals, magical beasts, or vermin) at bay unless they succeed on a Will save. Affected animals stay at least 30 feet away from you for the duration of the spell, as space permits. On a successful ranged attack with the whip, any normal animal you strike must succeed on a Will save or become frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgainst other creature types, you can use a sonic whip in combat as if it were a normal whip.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaterial Component: A miniature silk whip.\u003c/p\u003e","Descriptors":"Mind-Affecting, Sonic","Displays":"","DivineFocusComponent":false,"Duration":"1 round/level","Effect":"A whip of force","MaterialComponent":true,"MaterialDisplay":false,"MentalDisplay":false,"MetaBreathComponent":false,"Name":"Sonic Whip","OlfactoryDisplay":false,"Page":195,"Public":false,"Rulebook":"Spell Compendium","SavingThrow":"Will negates; see text","School":"Evocation","SomaticComponent":true,"SpellRange":"0 ft.","SpellResistance":"No","Subschool":"","Target":"","TrueNameComponent":false,"UserId":0,"VerbalComponent":true,"VisualDisplay":false,"XPComponent":false}}
