Magical writing such as a glyph of warding, explosive runes, sepia snake sigil, or symbol is covered by a blue nimbus of light (which sheds light equal to a candle). This effect reveals the location of the writing without triggering it. For every source of magical writing, you can make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against a DC equal to 11 + the writing\u0026#39;s caster level. If you are successful, the magical writing is suppressed for 1 minute per caster level.
