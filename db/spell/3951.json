Your hands become claws, granting you two claw attacks, and your mouth becomes that of a tiger, giving you a bite attack. You can attack with both claws at your full base attack bonus, but your bite attack takes a \u0026#8212;2 penalty (as if you had the Multiattack feat). Each claw deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if you are Small) + your Str modifier, and your bite deals 2d6 points of damage (2d6 if you are Small) + 1/2 your Str modifier. You gain the benefits of the Blind-Fight and Power Attack feats, as well.
