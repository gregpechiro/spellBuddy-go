At the same moment, a new path appears from the point you designate, wandering off in a different direction.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis spell simultaneously hides a path or road specified by you, while simultaneously creating an illusory path. The illusory path starts at a point chosen by you within the range of the spell. It continues  in the direction you indicate, to the limit of the spell\u0026#39;s area, where it ends abruptly. The illusory path avoids obstacles and provides no bridges, stairs, ladders, ramps, or other methods of traversing such obstacles. There is no way to force the illusory path to lead over a cliff or across a river more than 4 feet deep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose who fail their Will saves struggle along the illusory path. If vegetation or rough terrain slows their progress, they believe the path is sloping enough to justify the reduced speed. Those who succeed on their Will saves see both paths, but the illusory path is shadowy and obviously unreal.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 hour/level","effect":"","id":4160,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Shifting Paths","page":188,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"Will disbelief (if interacted with)","school":"Illusion","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","spell_resistance":"Yes","subschool":"Glamer","target":"","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
