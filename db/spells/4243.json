You can cause the arm to rise only out of earth, mud, grass, or sand, and the spell fails if you attempt to cast it in an area with the wrong materials (including stone).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eTreat the arm as a Medium creature, with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength of 14 +2 per three caster levels (16 at 3rd level, 18 at 6th level, and so on). The arm doesn\u0026#39;t move from the square it appears in, but can make one grapple attempt per round against any creature in its square or any adjacent square. Doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the arm can target multiple creatures, you choose one. If you are unable to choose a target, the arm attacks a random creature within reach (possibly including your allies). Each round when it successfully pins a target, the hand deals lethal damage equal to 1d6 points + its Str modifier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe earthen arm has AC 15, hardness 4, and 3 hit points per caster level.
