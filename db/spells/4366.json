You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target. You can make a single ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, or 2d6 points of damage against undead or evil outsiders, with a range of 30 feet. Spell resistance applies to this attack. This dims your silvery radiance to half (15-foot light, with dim light for an additional 15 feet). You can choose to fire one additional ray with the same characteristics either on the same round or on a subsequent round. Firing the second ray quenches your radiance and ends the spell.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Good, Light","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"10 minutes/level (D) or until discharged; see text","effect":"","id":4366,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Light of Lunia","page":132,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"None","school":"Evocation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","spell_resistance":"Yes; see text","subschool":"","target":"You and up to two rays; see text","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
