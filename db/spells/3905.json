While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to outsider (baatezu, evil, lawful), and your size changes to Large. You have the space and reach of a bone devil (10 feet/10 feet). You gain a +4 profane bonus to Strength and Constitution and darkvision out to 60 feet. You gain damage reduction 5/good.\u003cbr /\u003eYou also grow a tail like that of a scorpion. Whenever you take a full attack action, you can use the tail to make an additional attack each round at your highest attack bonus. A successful attack deals 3d4 points of damage + your Str modifier. This attack overcomes damage reduction as if it were an evil weapon. Creatures hit by the tail attack must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 character level + Con modifier) or be subjected to poison (injury, initial damage 1d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6 Str). Your equipment grows to match your new size and form, allowing the tail attack to function even if you are wearing heavy armor or other restrictive clothing. You gain the ability to speak and understand Infernal.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Evil","divine_focus_component":"1","duration":"1 round/level (D)","effect":"","id":3905,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Infernal Transformation","page":122,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"","school":"Transmutation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Personal","spell_resistance":"","subschool":"","target":"You","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
