This spell copies 250 words per minute and creates a perfect duplicate of the original. The spell only copies nonmagical text, not illustrations or magical writings (such as spell scrolls or a sepia snake sigil). If the target contains normal and magical writing (such as a letter with explosive runes), only the  normal text is copied, leaving blank space in the copied text where the magical writing would be expected. Likewise, if the target contains text and illustration, only the text is copied. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe spell triggers (but does not copy) writing-based magic traps in the material being copied. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eBlank paper, parchment, or a book must be provided for the spell to write upon. If the target has multiple pages, the spell automatically turns to the next blank page whenever necessary. If more pages in the target exist than blank pages are available, the spell copies the original until it runs out of blank pages. At any time during the spell\u0026#39;s duration you may redirect the magic to copy from another target, copy onto a different blank source, or resume a duplication that was interrupted by a shortfall of blank pages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf this spell is used to copy a spell from a spellbook, you must provide the necessary costly materials as if you were copying it by hand (see Arcane Magical Writings, page 155 of the Player\u0026#39;s Handbook). \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe spell does not translate the copied writing.
