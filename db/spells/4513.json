An affected creature appears in the location analogous to the space it occupied on the coexistent plane. For example, the make manifest spell allows you to cause a target on the Ethereal Plane to appear on the Material Plane, and vice versa. This spell does not grant the ability to pinpoint the location of ethereal creatures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the duration of the spell, the target creature retains all its abilities except for those that allow it to enter other planes. For example, a ghost brought in from the Ethereal Plane would be unable to return to the Ethereal Plane but would remain incorporeal. At the end of the spell\u0026#39;s duration, the target creature returns to whatever plane it was on before it was targeted by the spell, even if it has moved beyond the range of make manifest.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 round/level","effect":"","id":4513,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Make Manifest","page":137,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"Will negates","school":"Transmutation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","spell_resistance":"Yes","subschool":"","target":"One creature","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
