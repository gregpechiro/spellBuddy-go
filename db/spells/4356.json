The spell makes any action the subject considers attempting seem easily accomplished, requiring only a token effort. Deadly wounds seem like mere scratches, stalwart foes appear weak and intimidated, and the subject\u0026#39;s own attacks seem stronger and more effective. As a result of its skewed perceptions, the subject takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks, as well as to Wisdom. This penalty cannot reduce the subject\u0026#39;s Wisdom below 1. Finally, the subject becomes so completely enamored with its own (false) abilities that it cannot fight defensively or take the total defense action.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Mind-Affecting","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"10 minutes/level","effect":"","id":4356,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Delusions of Grandeur","page":63,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"Will negates","school":"Illusion","somatic_component":"0","spell_range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","spell_resistance":"Yes","subschool":"Phantasm","target":"One creature","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
