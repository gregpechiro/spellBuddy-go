The snake has hit points equal to your own full normal total. Attacks against the snake cause you no discomfort and do not disrupt your spellcasting. If it is \u0026quot;killed,\u0026quot; the tentacle disappears without causing harm to you. The tentacle does not interfere with spellcasting in any way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce each round as a free action, you can have the tentacle attack a creature up to 10 feet away with its bite attack, and if it successfully hits, the tentacle can use the snake\u0026#39;s improved grab ability to deal damage through constriction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn each round when the \u003cem\u003egutsnake\u003c/em\u003e is constricting a target, you cannot move more than 5 feet away from that target, unless the \u003cem\u003egutsnake\u003c/em\u003e makes a successful grapple check to carry the opponent with you when you move (see \u003cem\u003ePH\u003c/em\u003e 155 for grappling rules). This is the only way in which the tentacle restricts movement.
