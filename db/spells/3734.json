As part of this maneuver, you attempt a DC 20 Jump check. If this check succeeds, you can make a single melee attack against an opponent that you were adjacent to when you began this maneuver. This attack occurs in the air as you soar over your opponent, also as part of the maneuver. Your attack deals an extra 4d6 points of damage, and your opponent is considered flat-footed against this attack. You then land in any square adjacent to the target of this attack, though no more than 20 feet away from your starting position.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf your Jump check fails, you remain in the last square you occupied before the Jump check and can make a single attack normally.
