You can cast any spell of 3rd level or lower that has a range other tan personal through the eye. Any spell so cast functions as though it had been cast from the eye\u0026#39;s location rather than yours. Casting any spell of higher than 3rd level through the eye not only produces no effect (though the spell is still expended), but it destroys the \u003cem\u003eeye of power\u003c/em\u003e and ends the spell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike an \u003cem\u003earcane eye\u003c/em\u003e, an \u003cem\u003eeye of power\u003c/em\u003e is visible and corporeal, so it can be destroyed. The eye is a Fine object with AC 18 and 77 hit points.
