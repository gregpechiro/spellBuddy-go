At the same instant, you are transported to that creature\u0026#39;s home plane, where you exist in stasis for the duration of the spell. To a casual observer, it appears that you have transformed into the called creature (though an onlooker who makes a DC 25 Spot check notices the slight gap in time between your disappearance and the creature\u0026#39;s appearance). If the called creature would not fit in the place you occupied when you cast the spell, the spell fails. If the called creature is slain, you take 2d6 points of damage, the spell ends, and you are returned to your origin plane in the space last occupied by the called creature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA celestial creature (MM 31) called by this spell gains damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid 5, cold 5, and electricity 5; spell resistance equal to its HD +5; and a smite evil attack that provides a bonus equal to its HD on one damage roll.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA fiendish creature (MM 107) called by this spell gains damage reduction 5/magic; resistance to acid 5 and fire 5; spell resistance equal to its HD +5; and a smite good attack that provides a bonus equal to its HD on one damage roll.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou have full control over the creature\u0026#39;s actions and can perceive the environment around the called creature as if you were seeing through its eyes, hearing through its ears, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile in stasis, you can\u0026#39;t take any actions other than to control the called creature or to dismiss the spell, nor can anything on the creature\u0026#39;s home plane affect you in any way.
