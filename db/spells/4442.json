Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from her highest available level. Assuming the subjects survive, they regain lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level. Ordinarily, negative levels have a chance of permanently draining the subject\u0026#39;s level, but the negative levels from \u003cem\u003eenervating breath\u003c/em\u003e don\u0026#39;t last long enough to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf an undead creature is caught within the breath weapon, it gains 2d4?5 temporary hit points before taking damage from the breath weapon.
