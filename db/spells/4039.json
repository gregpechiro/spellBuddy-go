A creature that makes its initial Will save suffers no ill effects. A creature that fails its initial save can attempt a new saving throw each round until it succeeds or the spell expires. Failing the subsequent saving throws results in continued blindness. Success on a later save means the creature feels its vision beginning to clear, although its vision remains dim and hazy for the remainder of the spell. This results in a 20% miss chance for any attack the creature makes.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Mind-Affecting","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 round/level","effect":"","id":4039,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Cone of Dimness","page":50,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"Will negates; see text","school":"Illusion","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"60 ft.","spell_resistance":"Yes","subschool":"Phantasm","target":"","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
