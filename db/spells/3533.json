A creature can avert its eyes, which grants a 50% chance to avoid the gaze but in turn grants you concealment relative to it. A creature can close its eyes or turn away entirely; doing so prevents the gaze from affecting it but grants you total concealment from that creature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, you can actively attempt to use the gaze as a standard action each round. To do so, you choose a target within range, and that target must attempt a saving throw. A target that is averting or shutting its eyes gains the above benefits.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 round/level (D)","effect":"","id":3533,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Cast in Stone","page":43,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"None and Fortitude negates; see text","school":"Transmutation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Personal","spell_resistance":"No","subschool":"","target":"You","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
