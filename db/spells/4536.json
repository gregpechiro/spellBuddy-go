A creature within 5 feet has concealment, while creatures  farther away have total concealment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach round on your turn, the frigid mist deals 1d6 points of cold damage to each creature and object within it. The fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a maximum speed of 5 feet (regardless of its normal speed) and takes a -2 penalty on melee attack rolls and damage rolls and a -6 penalty on ranged weapon attack rolls (but not ranged spell attack rolls). A creature or object that falls into the fog from above is slowed, so that each 10 feet of mist it passes through effectively reduces overall falling damage by 1d6.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFreezing fog\u003c/em\u003e also coats all solid surfaces in its area with a slick, icy rime, and on your turn each round, each creature in the area of the fog must make a succesful Reflex save or fall prone. A creature that manages to stand must make a DC 10 Balance check in order to move, falling prone if it fails its save by 5 or more.
