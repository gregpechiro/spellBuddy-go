An elf subject to tortoise shell, for example, would have a speed of 20 feet and could run only 60 feet per round. The spell affects only a creature\u0026#39;s speed; tortoise shell doesn\u0026#39;t carry an armor check penalty or an arcane spell failure chance.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"1","duration":"10 minutes/level","effect":"","id":4306,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Tortoise Shell","page":221,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"None","school":"Transmutation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Touch","spell_resistance":"Yes (harmless)","subschool":"","target":"Living creature touched","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
