You grow several inches in height and become aware of a bending and lengthening of your spine. Glancing back, you see a second pair of hoofed legs and a swishing tail.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you cast this spell, you assume the physical appearance and many of the qualities and abilities of a centaur (MM 32). While under the effect of the spell, your creature type changes to monstrous humanoid, and your size changes to Large. You have the space and reach of a centaur (10 feet/5 feet). You gain the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution of an average centaur (Str 18, Dex 14, Con 15), but you retain your own mental ability scores. Your base land speed becomes 50 feet. You gain darkvision out to 60 feet. You can still use any extraordinary, spell-like, and supernatural abilities possessed by your normal form. You gain all the advantages of a quadruped form (greater carrying capacity, +4 bonus to resist trip attacks, and so on); this includes the ability to fight effectively while carrying a rider. You can still use your equipment and cast spells normally.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"1","duration":"10 minutes/level (D)","effect":"","id":4766,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Wild Runner","page":239,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"","school":"Transmutation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Personal","spell_resistance":"","subschool":"","target":"You","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
