You can revive a destroyed undead creature that has been inactive for up to one day per caster level. In addition, the subject\u0026#39;s animating spirit must be free and willing to return. If the subject\u0026#39;s animating spirit is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, subjects that want to revive receive no saving throw.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eRevive undead restores hit points to the subject up to a total of 1 hit point per Hit Die.

This level loss cannot be repaired by any spell. If the subject is 1st level, it loses 2 points of Charisma instead. An undead that was destroyed with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being revived, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A spellcasting undead creature that doesn\u0026#39;t prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing a level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaterial Component: A black pearl worth at least 5,000 gp.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Evil","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"Instantaneous","effect":"","id":4106,"material_component":"1","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Revive Undead","page":175,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"None","school":"Necromancy","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Touch","spell_resistance":"No","subschool":"","target":"Destroyed undead creature touched","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
