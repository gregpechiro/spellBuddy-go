You can make it seem 1 foot shorter or taller, thin, fat, or in between. You cannot change the creature\u0026#39;s body type. For example, a wight could look human, humanoid, or like any other generally human-shaped bipedal creature. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature, such as a mole or a beard, or make it look like an entirely different creature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form.
