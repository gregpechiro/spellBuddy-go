The upper half of the sphere projects above the ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. Once created, the \u003cem\u003edragonmark demesne\u003c/em\u003e cannot move. The top hemisphere can hold as many as twenty-five Medium creatures. Creatures outside the sphere cannot enter it without your permission, but any creature inside the sphere can move freely out of it. You can remove yourself from the sphere without ending the spell, but while you are outside the \u003cem\u003edragonmark demesne\u003c/em\u003e, you cannot use any of your dragonmark powers for as long as the sphere persists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe temperature inside the \u003cem\u003edragonmark demesne\u003c/em\u003e is a steady 70Â° F. The sphere also provides protection against the elements, such as rain, dust, and sandstorms. The sphere withstands any wind of less than hurricane force, but a hurricane or stronger wind destroys it (\u003cem\u003eDMG\u003c/em\u003e 95).
