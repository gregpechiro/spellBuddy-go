The gizzard pulses with glowing red blood and supernatural energy.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Large bulbous, fleshy mass seethes into being around a single Medium or smaller target within range. The target can make a Reflex save to avoid becoming engulfed by the hungry gizzard, otherwise it is entombed within the disembodied digestive organ. If the target successfully saves, the gizzard immediately vanishes without further effect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach round a creature remains trapped inside a hungry gizzard (starting in the round the spell is cast), the target creature is considered grappled and takes 2d8+8 points of crushing damage per round and 1d8 points of acid damage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile engulfed, the target creature can cast a spell only if the spell has no somatic component, the material components are in hand, and it makes a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). An engulfed creature can cut its way out by using claws or a light slashing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 12). Once the creature exits, the gizzard immediately melts into a pool of blood and meaty chunks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is no immediate physical exit; the only way for those trapped inside to escape is to cut their way free, to dispel the spell, or to have allies outside destroy the gizzard. The gizzard is fairly easy to strike in combat from a vantage point outside of its interior, due to its size (AC 4). A newly formed hungry gizzard has 5 hit points per caster level. The gizzard is treated like an unattended object for the purpose of saving throws. A hungry gizzard reduced to 0 hit points is immediately destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaterial Component: A dried gizzard.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 round/level (D)","effect":"","id":4711,"material_component":"1","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Hungry Gizzard","page":117,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"Reflex negates","school":"Conjuration","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Medium (100ft. + 10 ft./level)","spell_resistance":"Yes","subschool":"Creation","target":"One Medium or smaller creature","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
