It falls in a fixed area once created. The storm reduces hearing and visibility, resulting in a -4 penalty on Listen, Spot, and Search checks. It also applies a -4 penalty on ranged attacks made into, out of, or through the storm. Finally, it automatically extinguishes any unprotected flames and has a 50% chance to extinguish protected flames (such as those of lanterns).
