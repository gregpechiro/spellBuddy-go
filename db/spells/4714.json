For the duration of the spell, when thrown, the weapon returns to its wielder at the beginning of the wielder\u0026#39;s next action. The weapon returns whether it hit or missed its target. On its return, the thrown weapon hovers for 1 round next to the wielder and can then be seized and thrown again. After 1 round, the weapon falls to the ground. The weapon returns to its wielder only if thrown; it doesn\u0026#39;t automatically fly back if dropped or seized by another creature. (An improvised weapon or a weapon not designed for throwing has a range increment of 10 feet.) Throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 minute/level","effect":"","id":4714,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Hurl","page":117,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"None","school":"Transmutation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Touch","spell_resistance":"No","subschool":"","target":"Weapon touched","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
