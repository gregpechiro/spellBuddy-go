Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (although a 3rd-level or higher magical darkness effect functions normally), blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. In addition, if they fail a Fortitude save, affected creatures take 1d4 points of fire damage each round as their passions manifest as physically damaging fire. Creatures that make a successful Fortitude save take only half damage each round for the duration of the spell (minimum 1 point per round). Spellcasters affected by this spell who try to cast spells must make Concentration checks (DC 10 + half the continuous damage last dealt) each round as they take continuous damage from the spell. The fire created by this spell can be extinguished by normal means; doing so ends the outlining effect.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Fire, Light","divine_focus_component":"1","duration":"1 round/level","effect":"","id":4691,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Heartfire","page":112,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"Fortitude partial","school":"Evocation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","spell_resistance":"Yes","subschool":"","target":"","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
