This attack deals an extra 6d6 points of damage, and the creature struck must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 17 + your Str modifier) or be hurled 1d4 squares away from you, falling prone in that square. A creature of a smaller size category than yours gets a ?2 penalty on this save; a creature of a larger size category than yours gets a +2 bonus on the save. The enemy?s movement doesn?t provoke attacks of opportunity.
