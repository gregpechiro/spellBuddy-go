If there is no large, natural source of water (a river, lake, or ocean) within the spell range, you can affect only one target. If such a source of water exists within the range of the spell, the spell creates a burst centered on a location you designate. In either case, the water deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 7d8) to the target or to creatures within the area.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, all affected creatures suffer a bull rush attack, forcing them to make opposed Strength checks against the wave of water. The water has an effective Strength of 16 and is considered Medium size (or Strength 20 and Large if cast near a source of water). You designate the direction the wave pushes when you cast the spell; creatures who lose the opposed Strength check are pushed back 5 feet, plus an additional 5 feet for every 5 points by which the wave beats their Strength checks, in that direction. It is possible for a wave arising from a body of water to push characters into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe wave puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames if they are carried by the target or located within the area and they are Large size or smaller.
