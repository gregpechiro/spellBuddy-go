Anarchic water damages lawful outsiders the way holy water damages undead and evil outsiders. A flask of anarchic water can be thrown as a splash weapon. Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, the bearer must open the flask and pour the anarchic water out onto the target. Thus, a character can douse an incorporeal creature with anarchic water only if he is adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA direct hit by a flask of anarchic water deals 2d4 points of damage to a lawful outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMaterial Component\u003c/em\u003e: 5 pounds of powdered iron and silver (worth 25 gp).\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Chaotic","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"Instantaneous","effect":"","id":3828,"material_component":"1","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Anarchic Water","page":11,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"Will negates (object)","school":"Transmutation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Touch","spell_resistance":"Yes (object)","subschool":"","target":"Flask of water touched","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
