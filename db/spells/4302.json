You can freely make a thunderlance retract or grow to any length from 1 foot to 20 feet, but it always remains a straight lance of force. This effect gives you a natural reach of 20 feet. You can use a thunderlance to make powerful melee attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can wield a thunderlance in one or two hands, dealing a base 3d6 points of damage (crit 20/?3).
