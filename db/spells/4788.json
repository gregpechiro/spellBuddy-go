The \u003cem\u003eshockwave\u003c/em\u003e spell creates a burst of concussive force that disorients victims without causing any permanent damage, dealing 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per caster level (maximum 10d4) to every creature within the area and dazes them for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the dazed effect. The \u003cem\u003eshockwave\u003c/em\u003e has no effect on nonliving creatures or objects.
