While a spellcaster does not normally have line of effect to a bound elemental, which remains bound by a Khyber shard, a caster can establish line of effect by maintaining physical contact with the dragonshard while casting this spell. In such a case, the caster of control elemental would also need to have contact with the Khyber shard binding the elemental, or in the case of an elemental vessel, access to the helm, whenever he wished to give the elemental an order.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe elemental is commanded by voice and understands you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible (in the area of a silence spell, for instance), the targeted elemental does not attack you.
