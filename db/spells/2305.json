It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be banished. You can improve the spell\u0026#39;s chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target\u0026#39;s spell resistance (if any), the saving throw DC increases by 2. For example, if this spell were cast on a demon that hated light and was vulnerable to holy water and cold iron weapons, you might use iron, holy water, and a torch in the spell. The three items would give you a +3 bonus on your check to overcome the demon\u0026#39;s spell resistance and add 6 to the spell\u0026#39;s save DC.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the DM\u0026#39;s option, certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a +2 bonus on the caster level check against spell resistance and increasing the save DC by 4).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eArcane Focus: Any item that is distasteful to the subject (optional, see above).\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"Instantaneous","effect":"","id":2305,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Banishment","page":203,"rulebook":"Player's Handbook v.3.5","saving_throw":"Will negates","school":"Abjuration","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","spell_resistance":"Yes","subschool":"","target":"One or more extraplanar creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
