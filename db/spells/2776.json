All creatures must take the same kind of animal form; for example, you can\u0026#39;t turn one subject into a hawk and another into a dire wolf.  Recipients remain in the animal form until the spell expires or until you dismiss it for all recipients.  In addition, an individual subject may choose to resume its normal form as a full-round action; doing so ends the spell for that subject alone.
