That creature should be able to understand a language you know (otherwise, when the magic is activated, the creature knows that you sent the message, but has no idea what the message is). At any time afterward, you can send your interplanar message to that creature.\u003cbr /\u003eThe message pops into the target\u0026#39;s mind, awake or asleep, and the target is aware that the message has been delivered. If the message arrives when the target is asleep, it might appear as a vivid dream that the target remembers upon awakening.\u003cbr /\u003eThis spell does not obligate nor force the creature you communicate with to act. The target cannot reply to tell you its plans or intentions. The message travels through the Astral Plane to reach its target, so the spell cannot reach planes separate from (not coterminous to or coexistent with) the Astral Plane.\u003c/b\u003e  You can have only one interplanar message active at any given time.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Language-Dependent","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"24 hours/level or until  discharged","effect":"","id":3917,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Interplanar Message","page":124,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"Will negates (harmless)","school":"Evocation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"See text","spell_resistance":"Yes (harmless)","subschool":"","target":"One creature","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
