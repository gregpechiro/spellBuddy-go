The target falls prone in the destination space and takes 2d6 points of damage. You choose where he lands. For every 5 points by which you win the opposed check, you gain an additional 5 feet of throw distance. For example, if you win by 10, you can place your foe in any space within 20 feet of you. You must place the target in an empty space. If you lack the distance to throw your target into a clear space, he falls prone in his current space.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"","effect":"","id":3667,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Devastating Throw","page":71,"rulebook":"Tome of Battle: The Book of Nine Swords","saving_throw":"","school":"Setting Sun","somatic_component":"0","spell_range":"Touch","spell_resistance":"","subschool":"Strike","target":"Creature touched","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"0","xp_component":"0"}}
