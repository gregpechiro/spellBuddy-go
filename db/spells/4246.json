Medium creatures must make their Fortitude save or be knocked prone, and Large or larger creatures must succeed on a Fortitude save to move that round. Flying creatures that fail their saves are instead blown in a random direction, traveling 1d6?5 feet if Large or larger, 1d6?10 feet if Medium, and 2d6?10 feet if Small or smaller.
