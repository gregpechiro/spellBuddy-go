The blast of flame sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. If an interposing barrier shatters or breaks due to damage from this spell, the blast of heat may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any spell does.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eMindset: The energies you manipulate while preparing this spell cause an intense heat to well up within you.
