For example, you could have an \u003cem\u003eenergy transformation field\u003c/em\u003e tied to a \u003ca href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/summon-monster-v--2445/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003esummon monster V\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e spell that would summon a monster when the field had absorbed enough magic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe field absorbs the magic of spells cast, spell-like or supernatural abilities that are activated, and magic items used within its dimensions. Each source of magic provides spell levels of energy to the field equal to the spell level of the effect used. Supernatural abilities that emulate spells provide energy equal to the spell level of the effect. Super-natural abilities that do not emulate spells provide energy equal to the HD of the creature using the ability. For example, a cast \u003ca href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003efireball\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e spell or a charge from a \u003cem\u003ewand of fireball\u003c/em\u003e would add three spell levels to the field\u0026#39;s store, a \u003cem\u003epotion of cure light wounds\u003c/em\u003e would add one, and a \u003ca href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/wish--2902/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ewish\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e from a \u003cem\u003ering of three wishes\u003c/em\u003e would add nine. Items that don\u0026#39;t have a clearly defined spell level (such as the effects of most rods) use the prerequisite caster level needed to create that item (so an \u003cem\u003eimmovable rod\u003c/em\u003e would provide two spell levels every time it was activated because of its \u003ca href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/levitate--2830/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003elevitate\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e prerequisite).

Ongoing magical effects that enter the area, including spells cast from outside the area into the field or continually functioning items such as a +1 mace, are often visibly reduced, but do not have their actual effects hindered. For example, a \u003ca href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/continual-flame--2598/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003econtinual flame\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e would dim slightly, but its overall magic would not be affected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn \u003cem\u003eenergy transformation field\u003c/em\u003e has a single spell linked to it. When the field has absorbed spell levels equal to the spell level of its linked spell, it automatically casts that spell at a point within the field designated by you at the time of the casting of the field. This expends those absorbed spell levels (although unused levels remain until they are used or expire). The cast spell functions as if cast by you in terms of duration and all level-based spell effects. Absorbed spell levels fade at a rate of one per day if not used. The field automatically triggers its linked spell if it has enough stored spell levels and the duration of its previous casting has expired. If a linked spell requires concentration to maintain, the field expends one spell level for every hour of concentration (the field\u0026#39;s concentration is interrupted only by its complete destruction). Spells that require a target will target the living creature nearest to the field.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eTypical spells linked to an energy transformation field are \u0026quot;\u003cem\u003eblindness/deafness\u003c/em\u003e\u0026quot;:spells/players-handbook-v35\u0026#8212;6/blindnessdeafness\u0026#8212;2715/, \u003ca href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003efireball\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/suggestion--2573/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003esuggestion\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003cem\u003esummon monster\u003c/em\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/wall-of-force--2659/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003ewall of force\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.
