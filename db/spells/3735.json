As part of this maneuver, make a Jump check with a DC equal to your opponent?s AC. If the check succeeds, you can then make a single melee attack against your foe, also as part of this maneuver. The target is considered flat-footed against this attack. If your attack deals damage, your target must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 19 + your Str modifier). If this save fails, your target is instantly slain (his hit points drop to ?10). If the save is successful, you deal an extra 20d6 points of damage to the target in addition to your normal weapon damage. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the death effect of this strike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf your Jump check fails, you can make a single attack normally.
