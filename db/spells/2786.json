The weapon is treated as having a +1  enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing the damage reduction of evil creatures or striking evil incorporeal creatures (though the spell doesn\u0026#39;t grant an actual enhancement bonus). The weapon also becomes good, which means it can bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures, particularly evil outsiders. (This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the weapon might have).
