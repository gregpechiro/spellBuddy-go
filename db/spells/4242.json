Held creatures take 1d6+5 points of damage each round, at the beginning of your turn. Creatures that succeed on the Reflex save can move through the area normally. Creatures that start their turn in the affected area must attempt another Reflex save or be affected by the spell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA held creature can attempt a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check to break free, and can also break free by dealing enough damage to destroy the arm.
