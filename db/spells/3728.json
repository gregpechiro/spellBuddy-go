This attack deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. If the creature hit is standing on the ground, your attack also drops the target?s speed to 0 feet (for all movement capabilities) for 1 round. It can otherwise act normally. A successful Fortitude save (DC 12 + your Str modifier) by the creature struck negates the immobilization, but not the extra damage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis maneuver functions only against opponents standing on the ground. A flying creature or a levitating target need not save against the speed reduction effect, but still takes the extra damage.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 round","effect":"","id":3728,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Stone Vise","page":85,"rulebook":"Tome of Battle: The Book of Nine Swords","saving_throw":"Fortitude partial","school":"Stone Dragon","somatic_component":"0","spell_range":"Melee attack","spell_resistance":"","subschool":"Strike","target":"Creature struck","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"0","xp_component":"0"}}
