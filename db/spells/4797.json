The swirling shadows grant you concealment and soft cover (+4 to AC, but you gain no bonus on Reflex saves and cannot use your cover to make Hide checks). Furthermore, any creatures attempting melee attacks against you take 1d8 points of slashing damage from the raptor cloud. Creatures get no save against this damage, but spell resistance (if any) applies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreatures wielding reach weapons can attack you without taking damage, but creatures that have natural reach take damage as above.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough a raptor cloud moves with you, you cannot deal damage with it by pushing it against creatures or objects. Only creatures that make melee attacks against you are subject to the cloud\u0026#39;s defensive damage. However, you can elect to expend the spell\u0026#39;s energy at any point by tar­geting the raptor cloud against a single adjacent creature or object as a standard action.
