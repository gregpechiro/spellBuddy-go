You can strike an opponent with a melee touch attack, dealing fire damage equal to 1d6 +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you attack with a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand. Each attack you make reduces the remaining duration by 1 minute. If an attack reduces the remaining duration to 0 minutes or less, the spell ends after the attack resolves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis spell does not function underwater.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Fire","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 min./level (D)","effect":"Flame in your palm","id":2641,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Produce Flame","page":265,"rulebook":"Player's Handbook v.3.5","saving_throw":"None","school":"Evocation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"0 ft.","spell_resistance":"Yes","subschool":"","target":"","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
