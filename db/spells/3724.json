This attack deals an extra 2d6 points of damage. If the creature you hit is standing on the ground, your attack also causes the target to lose its ability to take a move action for 1 round. It can otherwise act normally. A successful Fortitude save (DC 14 + your Str modifier) by the creature struck negates the loss of its move action, but not the extra damage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis maneuver functions only against opponents standing on the ground.
