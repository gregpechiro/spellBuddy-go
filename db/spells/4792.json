A dream spirit is treated as an incorporeal creature that has your hit points and the AC you would have if you were incorporeal (it loses any armor bonus or natural armor bonus you have but gains a deflection bonus equal to your Charisma modifier or +1, whichever is greater).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe dream spirit appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. A dream spirit has a single incorporeal touch attack that uses your base attack bonus plus Dexter­ity modifier and deals ld6 points of damage, plus 1 per two levels (maximum 1d6 + 10).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a free action, you can mentally direct a dream spirit not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.
