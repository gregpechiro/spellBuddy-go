It can build a campfire, gather herbs, feed an animal companion, catch a fish, or perform any other simple task that doesn\u0026#39;t involve knowledge of technology. It cannot, for example, open a latched chest, since it doesn\u0026#39;t know how a latch works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA wood wose can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity if told to do so.
