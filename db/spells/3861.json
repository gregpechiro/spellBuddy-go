You are automatically considered proficient with the \u003cem\u003eice axe\u003c/em\u003e. Attacks with the \u003cem\u003eice axe\u003c/em\u003e are melee touch attacks. The axe deals 2d12 points of cold damage +1 point per two caster levels (maximum +10) with a successful hit. You cannot be disarmed of the \u003cem\u003eice axe\u003c/em\u003e nor can it be sundered. Since the axe is virtually weightless, your Strength modifier does not apply on damage rolls. If your base attack bonus is high enough to allow for multiple attacks in a round, you can make them with the \u003cem\u003eice axe\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf  you  choose  to  hold  something other than the \u003cem\u003eice axe\u003c/em\u003e in your hand or use the hand in some other way, the \u003cem\u003eice axe\u003c/em\u003e vanishes until the hand is empty again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaterial Component: A shard of ice, glass, or crystal.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Cold","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 round/level (D)","effect":"Battleaxe-shaped weapon of swirling ice","id":3861,"material_component":"1","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Ice Axe","page":118,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"None","school":"Evocation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"0 ft.","spell_resistance":"Yes","subschool":"","target":"","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
