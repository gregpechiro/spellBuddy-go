When this event occurs, the \u003cem\u003efortunate fate\u003c/em\u003e spell intervenes by immediately triggering a \u003cem\u003eheal\u003c/em\u003e spell upon the target. If the effect is one that causes harm in a way that a \u003cem\u003eheal\u003c/em\u003e spell can repair (disease, hit point damage, ability damage, or poison), the target does not actually die, saved by the heal. If the effect is one that heal cannot countermand (such as ability drain, old age, negative levels, disintegration, ability drain, or death effects), the fortunate fate spell cannot prevent the creature\u0026#39;s death.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"10 minutes/level or until discharged","effect":"","id":4531,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Fortunate Fate","page":99,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"None (harmless)","school":"Conjuration","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Touch","spell_resistance":"Yes (harmless)","subschool":"Healing","target":"Living creature touched","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
