Such creatures can breathe water for the duration of the spell as long as they remain within 10 feet of the ship. External forces, such as a storm or an angry dragon, can still jostle the ship and cause it to shake and possibly knock passengers and objects from it, but nothing falls from the ship as a result of your direction of its movement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can transfer control of the ship to another individual by giving that individual the miniature rudder you used as a focus to cast the spell.
