Simply cracking a sonic whip as a free action keeps normal animals (but not dire animals, magical beasts, or vermin) at bay unless they succeed on a Will save. Affected animals stay at least 30 feet away from you for the duration of the spell, as space permits. On a successful ranged attack with the whip, any normal animal you strike must succeed on a Will save or become frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgainst other creature types, you can use a sonic whip in combat as if it were a normal whip.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaterial Component: A miniature silk whip.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Mind-Affecting, Sonic","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 round/level","effect":"A whip of force","id":4194,"material_component":"1","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Sonic Whip","page":195,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"Will negates; see text","school":"Evocation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"0 ft.","spell_resistance":"No","subschool":"","target":"","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
