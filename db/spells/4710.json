The chain has a reach of 15 feet, but cannot move from the space you designate. The chain attacks by attempting to trip your foes (+12 melee touch attack, +15 on the opposed Strength check). It does not provoke attacks of opportunity for tripping, nor can it be tripped in response on a failed attempt. If it succeeds in tripping an enemy, it immediately follows up with a melee attack on the prone defender (+12 melee attack, 2d6+10 points of damage). Any creature struck by the chain must make a Will saving throw or become shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA howling chain can make one attack of opportunity each round for every four caster levels you have, using the same tactic as above.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA howling chain has as many hit points as you do when you\u0026#39;re undamaged, and its AC is AC 20 (-1 size, +11 natural).
