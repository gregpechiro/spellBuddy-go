This transmutation doubles the threat range of the weapon. A threat range of 20 becomes 19-20, a threat range of 19-20 becomes 17-20, and a threat range of 18-20 becomes 15-20. The spell can be cast only on piercing or slashing weapons. If cast on arrows or crossbow bolts, the keen edge on a particular projectile ends after one use, whether or not the missile strikes its intended target. (Treat shuriken as arrows, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eMultiple effects that increase a weapon\u0026#39;s threat range (such as the keen edge spell and the Improved Critical feat) don\u0026#39;t stack.
