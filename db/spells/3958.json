After casting blade storm, you can take a full-round action to make one attack with each melee weapon you are currently wielding against every foe within reach. If you wield more than one weapon, or a double weapon, you can attack each foe once with each weapon or end, using the normal rules for two-weapon fighting (PH 160). So, a ranger wielding a longsword and a short sword could attack each opponent he can reach with both weapons. If you choose not to spend a full-round action in this fashion after casting the spell,  the spell has no effect.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 round","effect":"","id":3958,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Blade Storm","page":30,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"no","school":"Transmutation","somatic_component":"0","spell_range":"Personal","spell_resistance":"no","subschool":"","target":"You","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
