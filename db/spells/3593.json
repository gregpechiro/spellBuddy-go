When rolling damage for a melee attack, you gain a special benefit from any damage die that rolls its maximum amount (such as a result of 6 on a d6). When one or more of your damage dice show a maximum possible result, reroll each such die and add its result to the original damage total. You can continue to reroll as long as a die shows its maximum possible result, adding each new number to the damage total until each die has shown less than a maximum result.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Chaos","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"Stance","effect":"","id":3593,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Aura of Chaos","page":57,"rulebook":"Tome of Battle: The Book of Nine Swords","saving_throw":"","school":"Devoted Spirit","somatic_component":"0","spell_range":"Personal","spell_resistance":"","subschool":"Stance","target":"You","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"0","xp_component":"0"}}
