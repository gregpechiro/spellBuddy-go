This attack deals an extra 4d6 points of damage. In addition, the target must make a Reflex save (DC 14 + your Str modifier) or become flatfooted until the start of his next turn. The target takes damage (normal melee damage plus the extra damage) even if his save succeeds. If the target cannot be caught flat-footed (he has uncanny dodge, for example), he still takes the extra damage from the strike but otherwise suffers no ill effect.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"","effect":"","id":3680,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Strike of the Broke Shield","page":74,"rulebook":"Tome of Battle: The Book of Nine Swords","saving_throw":"Reflex partial","school":"Setting Sun","somatic_component":"0","spell_range":"Melee attack","spell_resistance":"","subschool":"Strike","target":"One creature","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"0","xp_component":"0"}}
