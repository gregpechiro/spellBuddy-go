The missiles strike one creature initially, then spring to other targets. Each missile deals 1d4+1 points of force damage. One missile strikes the primary target per two caster levels, to a maximum of ten missiles (dealing 10d4+10 points of damage). After the missiles strike, they ricochet to a number of targets up to the number of missiles created by the spell. Each secondary target takes 1d4+1 points of damage, as if struck by a single magic missile. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no secondary target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum (to avoid allies in the area, for example). Missiles without a secondary target do not ricochet off the primary target.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpells, magic items, and abilities that protect against \u003ca href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/magic-missile--2631/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003emagic missile\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (such as the \u003ca href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/shield--2364/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eshield\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e spell or a \u003cem\u003ebrooch of shielding\u003c/em\u003e) also protect against this spell.
