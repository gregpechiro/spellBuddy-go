Your hands become claws, granting you two claw attacks, and your mouth becomes that of a tiger, giving you a bite attack. You can attack with both claws at your full base attack bonus, but your bite attack takes a \u0026#8212;2 penalty (as if you had the Multiattack feat). Each claw deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if you are Small) + your Str modifier, and your bite deals 2d6 points of damage (2d6 if you are Small) + 1/2 your Str modifier. You gain the benefits of the Blind-Fight and Power Attack feats, as well. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaterial Component: A tiger\u0026#39;s claw.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"","effect":"","id":3951,"material_component":"1","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Bite of the Weretiger","page":28,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"No","school":"Transmutation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Touch","spell_resistance":"No","subschool":"","target":"You","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
