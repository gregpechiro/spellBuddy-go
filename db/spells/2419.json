If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature\u0026#39;s name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple (fly us across the chasm, help us fight a battle) to the complex (spy on our enemies, protect us on our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from  donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature\u0026#39;s alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be  made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature\u0026#39;s ethos, the DM may halve or even waive the payment. For instance, a celestial creature called to battle demons might require a gift of only half the normal value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote:When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. For example, a lesser planar ally is a fire spell when it calls a fire elemental.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eXP Cost: 100 XP.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"see text","divine_focus_component":"1","duration":"Instantaneous","effect":"One called elemental or outsider of 6 HD or less","id":2419,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Planar Ally, Lesser","page":261,"rulebook":"Player's Handbook v.3.5","saving_throw":"None","school":"Conjuration","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","spell_resistance":"No","subschool":"Calling","target":"","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"1"}}
