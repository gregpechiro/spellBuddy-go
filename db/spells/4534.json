A target struck takes 2d6 points of cold damage. A creature struck must succeed on a Reflex save or be encased in a 5-inch-thick sheath of ice and be immobilized (and this helpless). A creature encased in ice takes 2d6 points of cold damage each round until freed. A target encased in ice is aware and breathes normally but cannot speak or move other tan to attempt to escape by making a Strength check (see below). It can still execute purely mental actions, such as using a spell-like ability. A spellcaster can cast a spell with no verbal or somatic component as long as the spell lacks a focus or material component, or the material component, focus, or divine focus is already in the spellcaster\u0026#39;s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ice blocks line of effect.

A swimmer can\u0026#39;t swim but because ice floats, the encase swimmer will rise to the surface and bob about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eA DC 22 Strength check breaks the ice, freeing the encased creature. Creatures other than the target can also attack the ice. The ice has hardness 0 and 15 hit points. When the duration of the spell expires, the ice melts and the encased creature is freed. Damage that would harm the creature must first deal enough damage to destroy the ice before the creature takes damage, and damage dealt to the ice is subtracted from damage that would be dealt to the creature.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Cold","divine_focus_component":"1","duration":"1 round/2 levels","effect":"Ray","id":4534,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Freeze","page":99,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"Reflex partial; see text","school":"Conjuration","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","spell_resistance":"Yes","subschool":"Creation","target":"","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
