As long as the creature isn\u0026#39;t carrying more than a light load, it can swim without making Swim checks. It also gains a +8 bonus on any Swim checks to perform special actions or avoid hazards, though it still takes the normal penalty for weight carried (\u0026#8212;1 per 5 pounds). The recipient can choose to take 10 on Swim checks, even if rushed or threatened, and can use the run action while swimming if it swims in a straight line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the creature is carrying more than a light load, it must make Swim checks to move (taking the normal penalty for weight carried), but all other benefits of the spell still apply.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaterial Component: A goldfish scale.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Water","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"10 minutes/level (D)","effect":"","id":4289,"material_component":"1","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Swim","page":217,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"None","school":"Transmutation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","spell_resistance":"Yes (harmless)","subschool":"","target":"One creature","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
