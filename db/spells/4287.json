If the target is unable to breathe water, it must cough it out. If it makes the save, then this expulsion is done with little effort. If it fails the save, the creature falls prone in a coughing fit for 1d6 rounds and is helpless during that time. Furthermore, on a failed save, the subject contracts filth fever (\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eDMG\u003c/span\u003e 292). Creatures able to breathe water must make the Fortitude save in order to avoid the disease, but are otherwise unaffected.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"1","duration":"Instantaneous","effect":"","id":4287,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Swamp Lung","page":216,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"Fortitude negates","school":"Conjuration","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","spell_resistance":"No","subschool":"Creation","target":"One living creature with a respiratory system","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
