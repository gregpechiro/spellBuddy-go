The spell must be cast so that it rests on a solid surface. Once cast, the wall is immobile. The sand is sufficiently thick to block ranged attacks, providing normal cover appropriate for its size, but creatures can attempt to force their way through it. Moving through a wall of sand is difficult, requiring a full-round action and a Strength check. A creature moves 5 feet through a wall of sand for every 5 points by which its Strength check result exceeds 10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreatures within a wall of sand are considered blinded and deafened, and they are unable to speak or breathe. Thus, they might begin to suffocate (\u003cspan class=\"caps\"\u003eDMG\u003c/span\u003e 304) if they remain within the wall too long. Spells with verbal components cannot be cast within the wall, and any other spell requires a successful Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreatures with reach can attempt to attack through the wall, but targets have total concealment and total cover, and the attacker must have a general idea where the target is located.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny open, unprotected flame thrust into a wall of sand is instantly extinguished.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eArcane Material Component: A handful of sand.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Earth","divine_focus_component":"1","duration":"Concentration + 1 round/level","effect":"A straight wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square/level (S)","id":4739,"material_component":"1","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Wall of Sand","page":235,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"None","school":"Conjuration","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","spell_resistance":"No","subschool":"Creation","target":"","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
