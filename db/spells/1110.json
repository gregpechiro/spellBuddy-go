While the spell is in effect, you can use a free action on your turn to direct a controlled gloom to attach itself to and envelop a particular target and follow it. The target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid being enveloped. Success indicates the gloom dissipates; failure means the target is surrounded by magical darkness. Once it is attached to a target, a gloom stays with that target until the spell\u0026#39;s duration expires.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOrigin\u003c/em\u003e: This spell was created centuries ago by a steel dragon who eschewed human contact and masqueraded as a cruel necromancer who dwelt in an isolated tower.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Darkness","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 round/level","effect":"","id":1110,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Scattergloom","page":118,"rulebook":"Dragons of Faerun","saving_throw":"Will negates","school":"Evocation","somatic_component":"0","spell_range":"Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)","spell_resistance":"No","subschool":"","target":"","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
