Using master air requires as much concentration as walking, so you can attack or cast spells normally.

You drop 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If you reach the ground in that amount of time, you land safely. If not, you fall the rest of the distance, taking falling damage normally. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, you also fall in this way if the master air spell is dispelled.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eFocus: A wing feather from any bird or the wing bone of any bat.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"1","duration":"1 round/level","effect":"","id":4541,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Master Air","page":139,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"","school":"Transmutation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Personal","spell_resistance":"","subschool":"","target":"You","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
