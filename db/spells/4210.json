The sphere flies up to 30 feet per round. The sphere stops moving when it enters a space containing a creature, automatically striking it.

Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust (though its equipment is unaffected). When used against an object, the sphere disintegrates as much as one 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is disintegrated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe effects of the sphere count as a \u003ca href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/disintegrate--2801/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003edisintegrate\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e spell for the purpose of destroying a wall of force or any other spell or effect specifically affected by disintegrate.
