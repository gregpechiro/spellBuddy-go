You can enter the space of any creature of your size category or smaller. If you enter and occupy all of the space occupied by such a creature, it takes damage equal to 2d6 + 1-1/2 times your Str bonus (if any).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can deal trampling damage to a creature only once per round, no matter how many times you move into or through its space. You must move into every square a creature occupies to trample it. If you move over only part of the space a creature occupies (for example, you are a Large creature moving over half the space of a Large opponent), it can either attempt an attack of opportunity against you or it can attempt a Reflex save (DC 15 + your Str modifier) to avoid half of your trampling damage.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"","effect":"","id":3721,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Mountain Avalanche","page":84,"rulebook":"Tome of Battle: The Book of Nine Swords","saving_throw":"Reflex half; see text","school":"Stone Dragon","somatic_component":"0","spell_range":"Personal","spell_resistance":"","subschool":"Strike","target":"You","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"0","xp_component":"0"}}
