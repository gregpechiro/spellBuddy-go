The weapon is treated as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the purpose of bypassing the damage reduction of good creatures or striking good incorporeal creatures (though the spell doesn\u0026#39;t grant an actual enhancement bonus). The weapon also becomes evil, which means it can bypass the damage reduction of certain creatures, particularly good outsiders. (This effect overrides and suppresses any other alignment the weapon might have).
