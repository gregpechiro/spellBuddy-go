This bonus pool consists of 2 points per caster level, which you can spend as you like to improve attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks, although no single check can receive a bonus greater than one-half your caster level. You must declare any bonus point usage before the appropriate roll is made. Used points disappear from the pool, and any points remaining when the spell ends are wasted. These points count as luck bonuses for the purpose of stacking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, a 14th-level bard pauses while chasing a pickpocket to cast improvisation.
