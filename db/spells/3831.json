When you successfully cast this spell, you imbue the energy of your breath weapon with coherence, mobility, and a semblance of life. The animated breath then attacks whomever or whatever you designate. The spell works only on breath weapons that deal energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) damage.
