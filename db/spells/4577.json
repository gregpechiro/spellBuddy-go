Undead and shapechangers take 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d8).

Disguised, shapechanged, or polymorphed creatures and objects in the spell\u0026#39;s area at the time the spell is cast must make Will saves or immediately return to their normal forms.

This radiance is as bright as the light of a full moon and negates electricity damage for 1 round per caster level unless the item or creature generating the electricity effect makes a caster level check (1d20 + item\u0026#39;s caster level or creature\u0026#39;s caster level) against a DC equal to 10 + your caster level. If an electricity effect is generated outside the glowing cone, the cone blocks the electricity effect unless the creature generating the effect succeeds on a caster level check. If an electricity effect is generated inside the glowing cone, the cone negates the electricity effect unless the creature generating the effect succeeds on a caster level check.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Light","divine_focus_component":"1","duration":"Instantaneous and 1 round/level; see text","effect":"","id":4577,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Moonfire","page":144,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"Reflex half and Will negates; see text","school":"Evocation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"60 ft.","spell_resistance":"Yes","subschool":"","target":"","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
