This spell does not work on clothing other than armor, but it does function with armor that already has spikes built in. The spikes are flexible enough not to hamper the creature wearing the armor. Each round, the first time the armor wearer attacks a target in melee, the spikes strike out as well, growing in length and hardness. The spikes have an attack bonus equal to your caster level and deal 2d6 points of damage. Your Strength modifier does not apply to this damage.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 round/level (D)","effect":"","id":3996,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Bristle","page":40,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"None","school":"Transmutation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Touch","spell_resistance":"No","subschool":"","target":"Suit of armor touched","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
