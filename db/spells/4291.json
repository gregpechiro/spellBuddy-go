The blade immediately attacks your enemy.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou cause a blade of pale green force to appear and strike the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round when the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter. Though it makes regular melee attacks, the sword strikes as a spell, not a weapon (and so can strike incorporeal creatures). A sword of deception always strikes from your direction, and so it can\u0026#39;t be used to flank with your attacks, but it could flank with your allies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe blade attacks with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level, dealing 1d8 points of damage per hit and threatening a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. In addition, each successful hit provides a -2 penalty on the target\u0026#39;s next saving throw roll (-4 on a successful critical hit). This penalty is cumulative (to a maximum of -5 on a single creature) and lasts until the creature is forced to make a saving throw in a dangerous situation or receives the benefit of a remove curse spell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach round, a sword of deception continues to attack the previous round\u0026#39;s target unless you use a standard action to switch it to a new target within range. In any round when the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack as a standard action (as it does in the round when the spell is cast). The weapon can make multiple attack rolls against a single target with a full attack action if its base attack bonus permits. A sword of deception cannot be attacked or damaged (though it can be dispelled as any other spell).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf an attacked creature has spell resistance, make a caster level check the first time the sword attacks. If the check is successful, the sword can attack that creature with normal effect for the duration of the spell. If not, the sword of deception is dispelled. If the target goes beyond the spell range or out of your sight, the sword of deception returns to you and hovers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eFocus: A miniature replica of a sword and a set of loaded dice.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"Force","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 round/level (D)","effect":"Pale green blade of force","id":4291,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Sword of Deception","page":217,"rulebook":"Spell Compendium","saving_throw":"None","school":"Evocation","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)","spell_resistance":"Yes","subschool":"","target":"","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
