(A creature is considered to own an item if it was the last creature to carry the item on its person for 24 hours or more. You do not count when considering what creature was last to carry an item.) This attunement grants you a +10 bonus on Search and Survival checks made to track the item\u0026#39;s owner or find evidence of the owner\u0026#39;s passage. This spell does not give you insight into who or what the creature you are attuned to is or where that creature ultimately might be.
