You can use this maneuver only against a foe of a larger size category than yours. As part of this maneuver, you make a Jump check with a DC equal to your foe?s AC. If this check succeeds, you also make a melee attack as part of this maneuver. If the check fails, you cannot make this attack and the maneuver is still considered expended.
