The drained level is restored only if the time since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than one day per caster level. Thus, if a 10th-level character has been struck by a wight and drained to 9th level, restoration brings the character up to exactly the minimum number of experience points necessary to restore him to 10th level (45,000 XP), gaining him an additional Hit Die and level functions accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eRestoration cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained).
