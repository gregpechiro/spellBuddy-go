You can\u0026#39;t choose to ignore this effect; that is, you can\u0026#39;t opt to cast a spell using its normal casting time. Thus, if all your spells normally have casting times of 1 standard action, they take 1 swift action instead, and because you can\u0026#39;t take more than one swift action in a round, you won\u0026#39;t be able to cast multiple spells per round while under the effect of arcane spellsurge. (If you have available spells with casting times of 1 full round, you are still able to cast more than one of those spells per round). However, a sorcerer or other spontaneous arcane caster could cast a metamagic spell (as a standard action) and a normal spell (as a swift action) in the same round.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis spell doesn\u0026#39;t stack with any other effect that reduces a spell\u0026#39;s casting time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpecial: If you are of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4), you can cast this spell as a swift action.\u003c/p\u003e","descriptors":"","divine_focus_component":"0","duration":"1 round/level","effect":"","id":1093,"material_component":"0","meta_breath_component":"0","name":"Arcane Spellsurge","page":64,"rulebook":"Dragon Magic","saving_throw":"","school":"Universal","somatic_component":"1","spell_range":"Personal","spell_resistance":"","subschool":"","target":"You","true_name_component":"0","verbal_component":"1","xp_component":"0"}}
