It monitors an area 20 feet wide by 90 feet long, though walls and other opaque barriers can curtail this area. If any Tiny or larger living creature enters the area guarded by the skull, it emits a piercing shriek that can be heard up to a quarter mile away. Every creature within 60 feet of the skull when it shrieks must make a Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d6 rounds. Whether or not you can hear this audible alarm, you instantly become aware that the effect has been triggered, provided you are on the same plane as it is. The alarm resets 1d4 rounds later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you cast the spell, you can specify creatures that will not trigger the alarm.
